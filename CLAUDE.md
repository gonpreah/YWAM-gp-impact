# GonPreah (YWAM GP) Impact App

A mobile-first, bilingual (Khmer-first) web app for YWAM GonPreah (កូនព្រះ), Cambodia.
It tracks ministry KPIs, OKRs, a weekly staff health check-in, and per-staff daily
logging across the Poipet and Siem Reap campuses.

## The name: always "YWAM GP", never a bare "GP" (Uriah, Oct 2026)
"We don't want GonPreah to be removed from YWAM, ever." In every word a person reads —
English and Khmer, the Library, emails, notes like these — a bare **GP** is written
**YWAM GP** ("at YWAM GP", "YWAM GP's values", "My YWAM GP"). A name that is "GP
<something>" stays as it is: GP Education, GP Media, GP Strengths, GP Impact, the GP app,
the GP Library, GP Director, GP Team, GPDTS (in Khmer the word comes first: កម្មវិធី GP,
បណ្ណាល័យ GP, នាយក GP…). Code names (GP_LIBRARY, gpT, gp-…) are not words people read.

## Architecture (single deploy target)
Everything lives in this repo and deploys as one Netlify site — push to `main`,
Netlify builds and goes live. No Google Apps Script, no Google Sheet, no separate
shell/app split. (Previously the app ran as an Apps Script web app wrapped in a
Netlify iframe "shell" — that setup is retired; see git history if you need it.)

- **`public/`** — the static frontend, served directly by Netlify (`netlify.toml`:
  `publish = "public"`).
- **`netlify/functions/api.js`** — the backend, a single Netlify Function replacing
  `Code.gs`. One POST endpoint (`/.netlify/functions/api`) dispatched by a `{fn, args}`
  body through the `HANDLERS` map, same function names/signatures the frontend already
  expects. No RPC marshalling quirks (unlike `google.script.run`, this is a plain `fetch`).
- **Storage: Netlify Blobs** (`@netlify/blobs`, store `"gp-data"`), one JSON array per
  former "sheet": `entries`, `okrs`, `survey`, `staff`, `dailyLogs`, plus a `loginThrottle`
  map. Read-modify-write, no locking — an accepted trade-off at this team's scale.

## Files
### public/
- **`index.html` is only the old address now (Oct 2026).** The leadership dashboard that
  lived there is **gone** — numbers are recorded on My Ministry (automatically from the
  ministry tools, plus manual entry there), Base shows the figures, the board has its
  Report. Uriah's call, Oct 2026: Base Finances ($) and Base Cash Reserve ($), which only
  the dashboard's leadership code could enter or see, are dropped — replaced by the
  **finance tool** (see "Finances" below; their stored values stay, nothing reads them). The
  page keeps the theme tokens and the splash (no flash on the hand-off) and a head script
  that forwards at once: the old dashboard asked for (`?view=dashboard`, or gp-skip-teams
  from old buttons) → `teams.html?view=base` (Base; a guest if nobody is signed in — it
  was public); a guest (gp-app-guest / gp-guest) → `teams.html?guest=1`; anyone else →
  `teams.html` with the same query. `gpGo('index')` opens Base. The error screen's second
  button clears this phone's kept copy and reloads.
- *(Removed, Oct 2026 — kept as history)* `index.html` — leadership dashboard (KPIs, OKRs), and the app's front door. Three tabs:
  Dashboard, Log Numbers, OKRs — **Health moved to the staff page** (see below). Has weekly ▲/▼ trend badges, a spinning-logo "Impact Loading" state,
  click-through drill-down on dashboard totals, and the ✦ Teams / 📖 buttons (plain
  page nav now, not postMessage). Calls the backend via the `apiCall(fn, args)` helper.
- **Where teams.html's code is (Oct 2026):** `teams.html` is now just the page — head, the
  inline theme tokens and splash (they must paint on the first frame, and tests compare
  them with index.html's), the markup and the script tags. Its styles are
  `public/teams/teams.css` — except the page edges and the html/body backgrounds, which
  stay inline for the first frame — and its code eleven plain scripts loaded in order:
  `teams/01-core.js` (state, render, helpers, Base) · `02-goals-okrs.js` · `03-library-org.js`
  (personality, Library, papers, guest, YWAM GP & the board, report, first 30 days, prayer,
  support raising, reminders, Khmer review) · `04-ministry-strengths.js` · `05-admin-hr.js` ·
  `06-numbers-contract.js` · `07-health-leave.js` · `08-team-profile.js` · `09-finance.js`
  (the finance tool) · `10-review360.js` (360 reviews) · `11-bind-boot.js` (bind() and starting the app). `finance.js` (public/,
  shared like taxonomy.js) reads the reports; `vendor/pdfjs/` is pdf.js, loaded on demand. **One global scope**, exactly as when it was one inline
  script: any function may call any other, but code that RUNS while a file loads (not
  inside a function) may only use what that file or an earlier one defines. Add new code to
  the file holding its section. A new file must go in teams.html's script tags, sw.js's
  PRECACHE (bump SHELL) and GP_VER_FILES (pull to refresh). Tests that read the page's
  source use `pageSource('teams.html')` from tests/env.mjs, which puts the files back inline;
  every test's little file server knows `.css` (a stylesheet served as text/plain is ignored).
  When this file says "in teams.html", read "in teams.html's code".
- `teams.html` — per-staff space ("My YWAM GP"), five tabs: **Base · My week · Team · Me · Health**.
  Username + 4-digit PIN, profile + photo, daily logging, streaks, mentor view +
  mentor-request approval, days away from campus. `?reg=1` opens the create-profile form
  directly (the front door links straight to it).
  **Base leads on purpose** — signing in shows who you are and then how the base is doing,
  not a to-do list. The personal cards live on My week. Base fetches `getData` with an
  empty leader code, so the two money metrics leadership can see never reach it.
  Base now carries **the whole dashboard**, section for section: your profile card on top,
  then the hero, salvations by department, both school groups, outreach, churches, the
  gospel totals, media, base health and the department explorer. A test asserts Base and
  the dashboard render the same section list, so the two can't quietly drift apart.
  **OKRs belong to a person, not to a tab.** `okrSectionHtml(who, mine)` renders one
  person's objectives, framed as a job description: that ministry's focus (from
  `jobfocus.js`) on a black card, then the objectives for **their department** — the only
  handle the OKR data gives on "whose objective is this", and the right one. It appears
  twice: on **Me** (your own) and on a **teammate's page** when you tap them in Team
  (theirs). Neither shows the rest of the base's objectives — these pages are about one
  person's work. Key results tied to a KPI show the quarter's real figure against the
  target, so it is visible the number came from what the ministry logged — nothing to type.
  🎯 means "objectives" throughout, which is why weekly goals use 🗒️.
  **The OKR page is laid out like SugarOKR.** Uriah asked for it, and Campus Leadership
  is the first team using OKRs.
  - The page shows every objective at once, numbered. A quarter summary sits on top
    (overall % and "Week n of 13"), and every key result shows. There is no pager and no
    "Show key results" fold.
  - Each key result has exactly one control:
    - a **slider** for hand-tracked % (`manual`);
    - a **− / + count** toward its target (`kind:"count"`, `current`). Tapping the number
      lets you type it, and three taps are one save;
    - nothing, when it is linked to a ministry metric (`metricKey`).
  - Key results can sit under a **heading** (`group`: Money, Time…).
  - The edit form opens in the objective's place:
    - one box per key result, and one "how is it measured" picker;
    - a target box only when the picker needs one;
    - "+ Heading" rows, and ✕ to remove a row;
    - up to 10 key results, which is the server's cap.
  - **📋 Paste OKRs** (`okrParsePaste_`) turns written OKRs into objectives:
    - "Objective 1:" starts an objective;
    - a bulleted or numbered line is a key result;
    - any other line under an objective is a heading.

    You see a preview first, then there is one saveObjective call per objective.
  - saveObjective puts re-saved rows back in the objective's old place, so moving a slider
    doesn't send the objective to the bottom.
  **Your own are editable, a teammate's are not.** On Me you can add, edit and delete
  your department's objectives, and type the percentage for a key result that has no KPI
  behind it (the only kind with a box — the rest are answered by what the ministry logs).
  A teammate's page has no controls at all.
- `logo.js` — the two brand marks as base64 data URIs, shared by both pages:
  `GP_LOGO_WIDE` (259×108 header wordmark) and `GP_LOGO` (the square mark that spins in
  the loading coin and pull-to-refresh). **Never regenerate these blobs** — they are the
  real assets. Both marks are white, drawn for the black header, so on the paper
  background they need a dark coin behind them or they vanish.
- `km.js` — the Khmer dictionary, shared by all three pages. **Two objects, and the
  split is load-bearing:** `REVIEWED_KM` (266 entries, checked by native speakers) and
  `PENDING_KM` (~219, translated by Claude at Uriah's explicit request and **not yet
  reviewed**). `BUILTIN_KM` merges them with reviewed last, so a checked string always
  beats a pending one. Never collapse them into one object — that would permanently
  lose track of what a human has actually read. As each string is checked, move it up
  into `REVIEWED_KM`; that is the whole workflow.
- `jobfocus.js` — `JOB_FOCUS` / `jobFocus(dept, ministry)`: what each of the 28 ministries
  is for, in one paragraph — the "job description" the OKRs tab is built around. Extracted
  verbatim from `help.html`, which still carries the same paragraphs inline so it needs no
  script to render. **Two copies, so they can drift** — a test compares them and also
  asserts every ministry in the taxonomy has a focus written for it. Edit one, edit both.
  Lookups take the department because Campus Leadership's "ministries" are named after the
  departments they oversee.
- **Numbers people (who is responsible for a ministry's weekly numbers).** Each
  ministry has a main person and a backup (`numbersPeople` blob, keyed
  `campus|dept|ministry`); with nobody set, its leaders are responsible. Numbers are
  **due Friday** of their week. Set by the ministry's leader, its department's Campus
  Leadership overseer, or an admin (`canSetNumbers_`); anyone on the ministry can
  still enter them — `canLogFor_` is unchanged. Outreach Teams and Campus
  Leadership's own rows have none (`numbersExempt_`, both sides).
  - My Ministry leads with the week's numbers card (`numbersHeadHtml_`: whose job,
    due / due today / overdue, "n of N entered", "Last entered by …") and opens the
    boxes by itself when the week has nothing in (`S.kpiAutoKey`); the schedules and
    the at-a-glance charts come after. Entries now record `by` (staff id) on every
    save path, which is where "last entered by" comes from (`withNumbers_`).
  - Reminders are bell items built by the page (`notifItems_`) from `S.numbers`
    (the boot's `numbersStatus_`): Friday "due today", from Saturday "overdue",
    Friday/Saturday-dated so Clear holds for the day; last week's missing numbers
    recur daily until in. They also show in My Home's Updates card. A department
    overseer gets the done / not done list on the same days, and on their own page
    (`numbersDeptCardHtml_`). Saving marks the week in at once (`numbersMarkLogged_`).
- `kpiguide.js` — `KPI_GLOSS` / `kpiGloss(metric)`: the KPI guide's one line on what to
  count for each metric, shown under the ⓘ beside each box people log (`kpiNameHtml_` in
  teams.html; hidden until tapped, toggled without a re-render so a half-typed number is
  never lost). Extracted verbatim from `help.html`; **two copies** — tests/test-kpi-guide.mjs
  compares them and checks every logged metric has a line. Edit one, edit both. Khmer for
  each line is in `PENDING_KM`. Not shown for Outreach Teams (left exactly as it is).
- **Scores and percentages have edges.** `kpiRange(metric)` in taxonomy.js (mirrored as
  `kpiRange_` in api.js, test-checked): a name ending "(1-10)" is 1–10, "(%)" is 0–100;
  counts and money have none (a day's count can be negative to undo a mistake; a profit
  can be negative). The page says so before saving (`kpiProblem_`, and `saveCard` on the
  dashboard); the server refuses out-of-range values on every save path and returns them
  in `rejected`, keeping the good numbers beside them. Outreach Teams is exempt.
- `taxonomy.js` — campuses, departments, ministries, metric lists, `STAFF_TYPES`, `COUNTRIES`,
  `modeOf()`, `compositeOf()`
  and the ministry emoji, shared by both pages.
- `rollup.js` — **the roll-up engine: the maths behind every dashboard figure.**
  `gpRollup({entries, survey, roster, week})` returns the read-only questions
  (`headlineFor`, `ministryRollup`, `healthScore`, `totalStaff`, `trendFor`, `drillRows`,
  `objProgress`, …) plus the pure globals `aggregate`, `lastBefore`, `fmt`, `qOf`,
  `addKnown`, `trendBadge`.
  It also owns **the drill-down sheet** — the only part of the file that touches the DOM.
  `gpDrillAttrs(metric, ids, dept, ministry, quarter)` on an element makes that figure
  tappable; `gpBindDrill(R)` after a render wires them all; the sheet lists every ministry
  that fed the total with its week-by-week values. Both pages use it, so a number means
  the same thing and opens the same way wherever it appears. It mounts itself (`#ddRoot` is
  created if absent), needs only `t()` and `CAMPUSES` from the page, and each page supplies
  its own `.dd*` CSS. Figures with no single source — a school count derived from several
  metrics, a health score built from check-ins — are deliberately left un-tappable rather
  than opening an empty sheet.
  index.html keeps thin one-line wrappers over it (`R().headlineFor(...)`) so its call
  sites read unchanged; teams.html builds its own instance for the Base tab. **Change a
  roll-up rule here and it changes for both pages — that is the point.** `week` is passed
  in because the two pages compute "this week" differently (index counts from the Monday
  of week 1, teams mirrors the API's ISO week); the engine only uses it to bound trends.
- `help.html` — bilingual clickable KPI guide (job focus + KPI explanations per ministry).
- `manifest.json`, `icon-180.png`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-maskable-512.png` — PWA assets: the
  YWAM mark and gold star on YWAM cobalt, full-bleed and opaque (iOS rounds the corners
  itself). The maskable one (Android's adaptive icons) is the same art shrunk into the
  safe circle, so the star isn't cropped off.

### netlify/functions/api.js
Handlers (see the sections below for the newer ones — HR, candidates, portal, structure, teams): getMyBoot, getData, saveEntries, saveObjective, deleteObjective, teamRoster,
staffRegister, staffLogin, updateProfile, changePin, uploadPhoto, saveDaily, getMyLogs,
getMyMentees, getMenteeLogs, getMyMentorRequests, respondToMentorRequest,
getMyWeekly, saveMyWeek, deleteMyWeek, saveGoals, saveMyHabits, getMyMinistry,
saveMyMinistry, saveMyKpiDay, staffProfile, getMyTrips, requestTrip, respondToTrip,
getTripRequests. No `translateBatch` equivalent (was `LanguageApp.translate`, not
available outside Apps Script) — Khmer strings machine-translation fallback is gone;
all Khmer must come from `BUILTIN_KM` or be added by hand.

**Netlify bills invocations, so a page open is one call.** `getMyBoot(username, pin)`
returns everything the staff page needs and `getData` carries the roster for the
dashboard. Both pages open on exactly one invocation — `audit-load.mjs` asserts that,
and it is the number to watch when adding a feature: a new `run()` on boot is a new
bill on every open, for every staff member, every day. Prefer widening `getMyBoot`.
`getMyBoot` deliberately does *not* fail as a unit — each section is caught on its own,
so a bad trips read cannot cost someone their base figures — and it returns
`{ok:false, err:'auth'}` for a bad PIN specifically, because only that should log
somebody out. A plain `!ok` used to, which meant a server hiccup signed people out.

**Every dated row carries a `year`, and reads are scoped to one.** Rows used to hold a
week number and nothing else, so week 33 of 2027 would have landed on top of week 33 of
2026 — summed metrics doubling, `latest` metrics silently replaced, last year gone. The
year is resolved at the API boundary and never leaves it: `getData(code, year)` filters
to one year and returns which one it used, so **`rollup.js` and both pages still work on
plain week numbers** exactly as before. Only `api.js` knows years exist.
`yearOf_(row)` is the single place that question is answered, and it takes the best
evidence available in order: an explicit `year`, the row's own `date` (kpiDaily and
dailyLogs carry one), its `updated` stamp, then `GP_LEGACY_YEAR`.
**Set `GP_LEGACY_YEAR` in the Netlify environment to the year the existing data was
collected in.** Rows written before this change have no year, and it cannot be recovered
— only inferred — so this is an *assignment*, not a recovery. Left unset it defaults to
the current year, which silently drags all the old data forward every January.

**Writing ministry numbers needs a name.** `saveEntries` took any POST at all: the front
door gated the form in the UI and the endpoint checked nothing, so anyone with the URL
could rewrite any campus's figures. It now needs either the leadership code (any campus,
as before) or a username + PIN (**that person's own campus only** — the campus lock
Uriah asked for). Nobody lost access: reaching that form has required an account since
the front door was added. A staff record with no campus is refused rather than guessed at.

**A bad blob must not take the app down.** `readJSON(key, fallback)` checks the value's
shape against the fallback (array for the row stores, object for `loginThrottle`) and
returns the fallback when it does not match. Every read handler used to pass whatever
was there straight to `.forEach`/`.findIndex`, so one malformed blob answered 500 for
every user at once. `saveMyMinistry` currently has no caller — it is a safe,
self-scoped write left in place, not a live path.

**`saveMyWeek`/`deleteMyWeek` bound weeks to 1-52**, matching `saveEntries` and both
week pickers. They allowed 53, which no screen can offer or read back, so such a row
would sit in the base average invisible to the person who wrote it. Each row's year is
the year its week belongs to — see the week-year bullet in "Known limits" below.

**The staff number is counted from people, not logged.** `staffType` (campus / yap /
ministry) and `country` live on the staff record, are asked for at sign-up and changed
from Profile & settings, and ride along on `publicStaff_` because the base counts by
them. `rollup.js` `staffBreakdown()` turns the roster into the split both pages render
through `gpStaffMixHtml()` — one function, so the base can never be described two ways.
Three rules hold it together:
- **The headline stays everyone at the campus.** The split only describes people with
  profiles, so when the logged 'Total Staff' is larger the gap is printed ("4 more staff
  have no profile yet") rather than quietly shrinking the base.
- **"Not said yet" is its own answer.** Nobody is guessed into a staff type or folded
  into Khmer/international because they left it blank.
- **One country is one string.** `cleanCountry_()` folds khmer/Cambodian/KH into
  Cambodia and title-cases the rest, because "how many countries" is only answerable if
  spellings cannot multiply. Unknown countries are kept, not rejected — a nationality
  missing from `COUNTRIES` is a gap in the list, not bad data. The three staff-type ids
  are duplicated in `api.js` (it must validate and cannot import a browser script):
  change one, change both.

**Enter each number once.** Two rules matter here:
- **Weekly health has one way in.** The eleven questions are a form on the Health tab
  (`saveMyWeek`), one row per person per week keyed by their `surveyToken`. Daily logs no
  longer derive a week. See "Health lives on the staff page" for who may read it.
- **Base health exports as slides, not as a file of rows.** "Export as slides" (on the
  Health tab's Base health section, both campuses, and on Base's Base Health row —
  `[data-healthexport]`, `hxOpen_`) opens a full-screen deck of the same pooled figures
  the page prints for the period the pickers are on: cover with the Staff Health Score,
  who checked in, the four 1-10/hours averages, the yes/no habits over two slides, the
  monthly add-on when any was asked, and a totals-only closing slide. One model
  (`hxModel_` → `hxSlides_`) feeds two renderers — HTML on screen and for print (PDF,
  one landscape page per slide) and a 1600×900 canvas for the PNGs — so a saved image is
  the slide on screen. Siem Reap's yes/no percentages come from `srCheckinForScope_` so
  they agree with its bars. Nothing on a slide names a person; "people answered" counts
  distinct survey tokens. Test: `tests/test-health-export.mjs`.
- **Quarter by quarter** is a View on both Base health pickers (`scope==='quarters'`,
  `hqHtml_`): this year's quarters side by side — the Staff Health Score as one column
  per quarter (`hqColumnsHtml_`, SVG: thin, rounded at the data end, latest quarter in
  the accent, earlier ones a lighter step) with `pctChange` on the quarter before under
  each, then every question as its own small column chart with the same ▲/▼. Quarters
  are the roll-up's 13-week blocks (`qOf`), only up to the current one. `hqModel_` is
  the one model; `hqSlides_` turns it into the deck's "By quarter" slides (kinds
  `qchart` / `qmulti`, drawn on the canvas by `hqCanvasColumns_`), which every export
  carries. Siem Reap's percentages come from `srCheckinForScope_` per quarter, so an
  imported quarter with no live rows still draws. Test: `tests/test-health-quarters.mjs`.
- **Ministry KPIs** are typed per day into the `kpiDaily` blob; `saveMyKpiDay` then
  recomputes that week's figure into `entries` (the array the dashboard reads) using
  the metric's own sum/latest/avg rule. Correcting Tuesday only changes Tuesday.
  The aggregation rule lives in the frontend taxonomy, so the client sends it and the
  server validates it's one of the three — a wrong mode can only misaggregate that
  ministry's own metric.
  **Consequence to know:** for a ministry+week that has daily rows, those days are
  the source of truth. A leader editing the same weekly cell on the dashboard will
  be overwritten the next time someone logs a day for it.
- **My week carries the ministry's whole log form, split by `modeOf()`** — the same
  rule the dashboard reads each metric with, so the two pages ask for a number the
  same way:
  - `sum` (counts) → the **daily** card. The box is today's addition and prints what
    the week becomes; `base` subtracts today's already-saved value so today is never
    counted twice. Saved with `saveMyKpiDay`.
  - `latest` / `avg` (levels and scores) → the **weekly** card, saved with
    `saveMyMinistry`. `latest` metrics are **carried forward** pre-filled from
    `lastBefore()` and marked `data-carried`, with the ▲/▼ change against that week
    shown as you type. Carried values ARE written on save — otherwise "unchanged"
    would read as "no data" for the week and the carry-forward would never become
    real. `avg` does not carry: a 1-10 score is a judgement about this week, not a
    level, and the dashboard does not carry it either.
  Every row that has an earlier week shows it — `gpVsLastWeek()` prints the previous
  figure in the metric's own format plus a ▲/▼ against it, direction from
  `LOWER_BETTER` so falling expenses read as good news. A first week shows nothing
  rather than inventing a zero baseline and calling it a 100% rise. The dashboard's
  log form uses the same helper, so both places compare the same way.
  **Never write a level as a daily row.** A headcount is not something you add up,
  and the daily roll-up owns any metric it touches, so the two would fight over the
  same weekly cell. `test-ministry-kpis.mjs` asserts the split from both sides.

**A key result says when its own target is wrong.** `krProgress()` caps the
percentage at 100 — nothing prints "7668% complete" any more — and returns the
uncapped figure as `raw`, because the cap alone turns a bad target into a full bar
reading 100% for the whole quarter, which looks like an objective that was met.
Two places use `raw`, both from one helper so the two pages cannot word it
differently: `gpKrWarnHtml()` puts a line under the key result on the dashboard and
on My Database, and `gpKrTargetNote()` says the same thing in the OKR editor as the
target is typed, against what that metric has already logged this quarter. Fix the
target where it was set; the app is not guessing which of the two numbers is wrong.

## The leadership department's name
The department is **Campus Leadership** (it was 'Base Director', then 'Base Leadership'),
and its own ministry row — the campus director's figures — is **Campus Director** (it was
'Campus Leadership', which collided with the department's new name). `BL_DEPT` in
taxonomy.js and `LEADERSHIP_DEPT` in api.js both hold the department name. **The store
was never rewritten**: rows keep the name that was current when they were written, and
`normRows_` in api.js normalises `dept`/`ministry` (plus OKR `metricKey`s and staff `leads`)
on every read of `staff`, `entries`, `kpiDaily`, `okrs` and `metricOverrides`, and every
incoming department/ministry in a payload — so the rest of the code, and the client, only
ever see the current names, and ordinary writes persist them. `test-leadership-rename.mjs`
seeds the store with the old names and checks every read and every department-keyed right.
Do not add a fourth name without extending `OLD_LEADERSHIP_DEPTS`.

**A ministry that moved department** rides the same layer: `MINISTRY_MOVES` in api.js maps
old `'dept|ministry'` to the department it is in now, and `normDept_(dept, ministry)` applies
it everywhere `normRows_`/`normKey_` run (rows, OKR `metricKey`s, `leads`, `ministries`,
`numbersPeople` keys on read, incoming payloads). Intercession: Community Service → Youth
Education (Oct 2026). Move a ministry in taxonomy.js AND add it to `MINISTRY_MOVES`, or its
history is orphaned (`test-numbers-people.mjs` §5 covers the move).

## My Ministry — one ministry at a time
One page (`myMinistryHtml`), two tabs — **Numbers** and **OKRs** (`S.mmTab`). Numbers is
built around ONE ministry, picked at the top and named in a banner (`#mmBanner`) so there
is never a doubt whose boxes these are:

- **Who can pick what** (`mmOptions_`, mirroring `canLogFor_`): only the ministries you
  are part of. That is your **main ministry** (profile dept + ministry), your **other
  ministries** (`ministries`: "Dept|Ministry" keys, ticked on your own profile under "Other
  ministries I’m part of" or by an admin on the person page; `cleanMinistries_` drops
  repeats, malformed keys and the main one), any ministry you **lead**, and for a Campus
  Leadership overseer (dept Campus Leadership, ministry = a department name) every ministry
  in that department. **An admin gets every ministry on their campus** (role `admin`, after
  their own; `canLogFor_` lets an admin see and enter any ministry on their own campus, the
  Teams Database included), always as the two dropdowns. Everyone else sees only their own.
  The banner says which it is: "Your main ministry", "One of your ministries", "You lead this
  ministry" or "As an admin you can see and enter…". ≤ 8 options are chips (not for admins)
  (`[data-mmpick="Dept|Min"]`, split at the LAST `|`), more are two selects
  (`#mmBrowseDeptSel` / `#mmBrowseMinSel`). Selection lives in `S.mmBrowseDept` /
  `S.mmBrowseMinistry` (`mmSelected_`; a department picked with no ministry → its first
  weekly ministry). A Campus Leadership person's own row — Total Staff, one-on-ones, the
  leadership figures — sits **last** as "Campus Leadership figures" and is never the
  default; the old "Individual — your own numbers…" block at the top is gone.
- **For the picked ministry**: `ministryDashboardHtml_` with a Month · Quarter · Year ·
  Year to date toggle (`S.mmPeriod`, `weekInPeriod_`), then the status card
  `ministryWeekStatusHtml_(data, wk, ovMin)` — week picker, the eight-week strip of
  logged / not-logged weeks, and the one `#kpiInputBtn` that unfolds the form. Your own
  ministry gets the full daily/weekly `kpiCardHtml` (ids `kpiPrevWeek`, `data-kpigoto`,
  `S.kpiInputOpen`); any other ministry gets the weekly rows `ovWeekRowsHtml_`
  (attributes `data-ovprev/ovnext/ovjump/ovgoto/ovinput="Min"`, `S.ovWeek[min]`,
  `S.ovInputOpen[min]`, data in `S.oversee[min]` loaded lazily via `getMinistryFor`).
  Outreach Teams shows a door to the **Teams Database** instead (`#goTeamsDb` →
  `S.view='teamsdb'`, `teamsDbHtml`).
- **A failed on-demand load is never "Loading…" for ever.** `getMinistryFor` and
  `getTeamTrips` are fetched with an `onErr`: the error text lands in `S.ovError[min]` /
  `S.teamError[campus]`, the page shows a card with the server's own words and **Try
  again** (`#ovRetry` / `#teamRetry`), and the loader condition checks the error flag so
  it doesn't re-fire on every render (that was a request storm). `run()` now carries the
  function's `{error}` text on a non-2xx into the thrown message, so a 500 says what
  crashed. `test-ministry-load-error.mjs` covers both pages.
- **Ministry leaders own the metric list.** `leads` on the staff record is a list of
  `"Dept|Ministry"` keys, set only by an admin (Admin → Accounts → Edit profile →
  "Ministry leader of"; `adminUpdateStaff`). `canEditMetrics_` in `api.js` is: admin, or
  the campus leadership department, or that ministry's leader. Logging numbers
  (`canLogFor_`): anyone in the ministry (main or other), its leader, its overseer. Not
  an admin as such. The client mirrors it in `canEditMetricsClient_` to draw "Edit what we track".
- **Renaming a custom metric moves its numbers** (`renameCustomMetric`): weekly
  `entries`, `kpiDaily` rows and any key result's `metricKey` follow the name, scoped to
  that campus/dept/ministry. Baseline metrics can't be renamed — they are the taxonomy.
- **Personal numbers are off the page for now.** `personalKpi` blob, `saveMyPersonalWeek`
  / `getMyPersonal`, `personalCardHtml_` and `PERSONAL_METRICS` all still exist (and the
  server tests cover them), but nothing renders them until the ministry numbers are
  rolling. Don't put them back at the top.
- `test-ministry-leader.mjs` (server) and `test-ministry-redesign.mjs`,
  `test-ministry-browse.mjs`, `test-personal-metrics-cadence.mjs` (browser) cover it.

## YWAM GP: four parts, titles, and the advisory board (Oct 2026)
Uriah: YWAM GP is YWAM Poipet, YWAM Siem Reap, **YWAM GP** (the organisation) and the
**YWAM GP Advisory Board**.
- **Campus Leadership titles** are read off the department, which is unchanged (its
  ministries are join keys): `orgTitle_` (api.js) / `orgTitleOf_` (teams.html) — a Campus
  Director is the **International** or **National Campus Director** (`cdKind`, admin-set,
  "If Campus Director: which one"), everyone else on the team **Director of <department>**
  (Khmer: នាយក + the department). They show on My Ministry (Campus Leadership: "Your role"
  on every tab, the team card on Overview), the org chart (Campus Directors / Department
  directors / Director — "Overseer" is gone), and a person's page.
- **YWAM GP's leadership team** (`gpRole`, admin-set from a fixed list, `GP_ROLE_IDS` /
  `GP_ROLES`): its **Director(s)** and a lead for each of five areas — **Campuses, Leaders,
  Music, Media, Education**. On top of a person's campus role; the YWAM GP page shows
  every place, an empty one as "Not filled yet". One person can hold all three kinds of
  role at once — a campus title, a YWAM GP place and a linked board seat — with one login.
- **Several positions, set together** (Oct 2026, Uriah: "select multiple positions … for me
  I'm on the board, YWAM GP & Siem Reap Leadership"): `gpRoles` (a list — `cleanGpRoles_`,
  `gpRolesOf_`; `gpRole` is kept as the first, and a lone `gpRole` still saves) and the
  board seat both sit in **Admin → a person's account → Positions** (`admPositionsHtml_`):
  tick the YWAM GP places, tick "On the YWAM GP Advisory Board" and pick the role.
  `adminUpdateStaff`'s `board: { on, role }` → `setStaffBoardSeat_`: makes or brings back
  their linked board member, or takes it off (kept inactive — bio and photo stay; Admin →
  Advisory Board edits those). `adminListStaff` carries each person's `board` seat.
  `getYwamGp` lists a person once per place they hold; their page shows every place; Profile
  & settings → **My positions** lists campus title, ministries led, YWAM GP places, board.
  tests/test-ywam-gp.mjs, test-ywam-gp-ui.mjs.
- **Safeguarding contacts** (`safeguarding` on a board member, admin-set): a serious
  concern ("Raise a concern") goes ONLY to them, because YWAM GP's own leaders sit on the
  board (Uriah is President and Naomi Secretary) — ideally people not on staff, and Admin
  warns when a staff member is marked. "Email the whole board" stays for ordinary contact.
  No contact marked → no concern card.
- **The advisory board is not staff**: its own `board` store, so nobody on it is ever in a
  roster, headcount, health figure, required papers or the org chart. A member: name, role
  (President / Secretary / Treasurer / Advisor, or another), email, phone, bio, photo. A
  member who is staff is linked (`staffId`, their profile's name/photo/email, their staff
  login); anyone else gets a username + PIN (`boardLogin`) — usernames are one namespace
  with staff (`usernameTaken_`, staffRegister, adminUpdateStaff). Admin → Advisory Board
  (`adminListBoard` / `adminSaveBoardMember` / `adminDeleteBoardMember`).
- **`getYwamGp`** (also the boot's `org`) — for staff or a board member (`verifyViewer_`
  picks the store by username, so a board member's requests never count as failed staff
  logins): titles, YWAM GP roles, each campus's leadership team, who leads each ministry,
  staff counts, and the board. **teamRoster and staffProfile gain nothing.**
- **The YWAM GP page** (☰ → YWAM GP, `S.view='ywamgp'`): GP leadership, both campus
  leadership teams, and the board with Email / Call for each and "Email the whole board",
  under a note that anything serious — about a leader, safety, abuse, misconduct — can
  go straight to them.
- **Team → Structure → 🌏 YWAM GP** (`S.teamCampus='ywamgp'`, only in Structure, not the
  Directory; `ywamGpChartHtml_`): the whole chart on one screen — the Advisory Board box
  (dashed, "advises") over the YWAM GP Leadership Team (every `GP_ROLES` place, empty ones
  "Not filled yet") over a box per campus (its leadership team + "Open <campus>'s chart").
  Someone with several roles appears in each box. Same `org` data; nothing new on the server.
- **YWAM GP and Advisory Board in every Team view** (Directory · Structure · Strengths ·
  Personalities; `teamOrgScope_` / `teamPeopleIn_`): the buttons 🌏 YWAM GP and 🛡️ Advisory
  Board sit before the campuses. Directory → YWAM GP lists each place and who holds it;
  Directory or Structure → Advisory Board is the board with contacts. Strengths and
  Personalities match `org` against the roster, so a board member shows only when also on
  staff (the board store holds no type or strengths). The button says "Advisory Board"
  because "Board" is already the meeting board (ក្តារ) in Khmer.
- **Campus Leadership picks its own title** (Profile & settings → Main ministry, and
  sign-up): International Campus Director, National Campus Director, or Director of
  <department>. The option value is `Campus Director#<cdKind>` (`minSelValue_`);
  `updateProfile` / `staffRegister` accept `cdKind` (CD_KINDS only). Admins can still set it.
- **Moving yourself INTO Campus Leadership waits for an admin** (Uriah, Oct 2026), like a
  Campus Leadership sign-up: `updateProfile` saves the rest of the profile but keeps the
  move as `cltRequest` {ministry, cdKind, at} (`cltPending: true` in the answer; shown in
  Profile & settings with "Cancel the request" → `cancelCltRequest`). Admin → Approvals
  lists them under "Moving into Campus Leadership" → `adminDecideCltRequest(…, staffId,
  yes)`. Nobody outside Campus Leadership can add a Campus Leadership row as an extra
  ministry either. Moving within, or out of, Campus Leadership needs nobody.
- **Filling it in**: Admin → Loose ends has "The YWAM GP structure isn't filled in" — each
  campus's Campus Directors with no International / National chosen, and every YWAM GP place
  nobody holds. Admins also get a banner on the YWAM GP page with the count and a link there.
- **The quarter report** (`S.view='report'`; the board's **Report** tab, and "The quarter
  report the board sees" on the YWAM GP page for Campus Leadership and admins;
  `boardReportHtml_`): YWAM GP as a whole and each campus for one quarter of this year, each
  figure with last quarter's under it — staff (today), Staff Health Score (only from
  `REP_MIN_ANSWERS` = 3 check-ins or more), salvations, leadership-school students and
  graduates, community-school students — then the campus leadership team and the quarter's
  objectives with their progress. Only what the board already sees (public getData, roster
  counts, org). "Print or save as PDF" → window.print(); `body.repOn` print rules hide the
  app around it.
- **A board member's sign-in** is a guest-mode variant (`S.board`, `S.guest` true, staff
  `S.auth` empty, `gp-board` in localStorage; index.html sends them here): tabs YWAM GP ·
  Campuses (each campus's leadership, departments with directors and ministry leaders,
  then the public base figures) · Library; nothing staff. The login screen tries
  `boardLogin` after a staff login fails with no other reason.
- tests/test-ywam-gp.mjs (server, 40), tests/test-ywam-gp-ui.mjs (browser, 47).

## Team → Structure (the org chart)
The Team tab has a Directory / Structure toggle (`S.teamMode`). Structure (`orgChartHtml_`)
is the campus as **levels**, the way the Canva chart reads: **Campus Leadership** on top
(the directors — dept Campus Leadership, ministry Campus Director — crowned, then the
department overseers), a connector, then **one box per department** with its overseer and
its ministries, each ministry naming its leader (crown, from `staff.leads`) and its people.
**Departments and ministries only, from profiles**: the boxes are the taxonomy's
(`getDepartments`), the people come from their department / ministry / leads, so moving
someone is editing their profile in Admin — nothing to hand-draw, nothing fetched, no
quarter chips. A person whose profile points nowhere on the chart lands in a dashed
"Not placed yet" box rather than vanishing. Tap anyone → `data-person` → their page.
**Quarters** (`orgStructureHtml_`): a year picker and Q1–Q4 chips (`S.structYear` /
`S.structQ`). The **current quarter is live** from profiles; an admin's "Save this quarter's
snapshot" (`saveStructure`) has the SERVER build a snapshot — `{campus, year, quarter,
people:[{id,name,dept,ministry,role,leads}], savedAt, savedBy}` from the campus's active,
non-archived staff, no photos — into the `structure` blob, replacing the same quarter. Any
other quarter is drawn from its snapshot (`getStructure`: exact → `saved`, else the latest
earlier one → `copied`, else `none`), cached in `S.structCache` by campus|year|quarter, so
the base can look back as people move. Snapshots carry names, so they render after
someone leaves. An earlier version had hand-editable team boxes; it read as messy and was
removed — don't bring the editor back. `test-org-chart.mjs` (browser) and
`test-structure.mjs` (server) cover it.

## Outreach Teams — one record per team, not a weekly form
Outreach Teams (Community Service) doesn't log week by week: a team comes for a stretch
and its numbers are gathered once, when it leaves. So picking it on My Ministry shows a
door to the **Teams Database** page (`S.view='teamsdb'`, `teamsDbHtml` →
`teamsMinistryHtml_`) instead of the week strip / metric form: a Month · Quarter · Year
toggle with a year picker, a dashboard that adds up the teams that **finished** in that period (a team
counts in the period it leaves; a team still here or coming sits in its own list
below), and one card per team with **Edit**. "Add a team" is one form
(`teamFormHtml_`): name, sending base, country, arrived/left, people / men / women /
couples / families, hosted-by, focus, status, every Outreach Teams metric as a total for
the visit (`teamMetrics_` = `metricsFor(...)` minus `Teams Hosted`, so custom metrics
show up here too), men/women reached, notes.

- **Store**: the `teamTrips` blob, one row per team `{id, campus, name, org, country,
  from, to, size, males, females, couples, families, staff, focus, status, notes,
  metrics:{}, reached:{male,female}}`, laid over `netlify/functions/team-seed.js` — the
  30 Siem Reap teams imported from the old Lovable "Outreach Metrics Hub" (`src:
  'lovable'`). `getTeamTrips_` merges seed and stored rows **by id**; editing a seeded
  team writes a full row under its id, deleting one writes a tombstone `{id, deleted}`.
  The seed file is data — never rewrite it. Several 2024–25 seeded teams share
  identical totals; that is how the hub held them.
- **Rights** are `canLogFor_` for Community Service / Outreach Teams — its own staff (main
  or other ministry), its leader, its overseer — echoed back as `canEdit`, which the client
  obeys (no Add/Edit when false). `saveTeamTrip` cleans the record (`cleanTrip_`: name
  required, ISO dates with `to ≥ from`, `Teams Hosted` and SENSITIVE metrics dropped).
- **Everything else still reads weekly rows.** `teamEntryRows_` turns the trips into
  entries — `Teams Hosted` +1 and each metric's total — in the ISO week the team LEFT,
  and `withTeamRows_` lays them over `getEntries_()` in `getData` and in the ministry's
  own payload, **replacing** a hand-logged row for the same campus / metric / year /
  week so nothing double-counts. A cancelled team produces no rows. The Base dashboard
  and the GP roll-up know nothing about trips.
- `getMyBoot` carries `teamTrips` only for Outreach Teams staff; everyone else loads them
  on demand (`#teamsPage[data-campus]` in `bind()`).
- **Every server test copies `team-seed.js` next to `api.js`** (api.js imports it) — a
  new server test needs that line too.
- `test-team-trips.mjs` (server) and `test-outreach-teams.mjs` (browser) cover it.

## SR Hospitality — rooms, beds and bookings
The Hospitality team's booking book (`S.view='hosp'`, `hospHtml` / `bindHosp` in
teams.html), reached from the menu (`canHospClient_()`) and from a button on My Ministry
when Skills Training › Hospitality is picked (`#goHosp`). Five tabs, phone first:
Dashboard (tonight's tiles; how full each week / month / quarter is, as bars coloured
quiet / busy / full with unbooked team requests striped on top, and the busiest and
quietest bucket named), Requests, Calendar, Bookings, Rooms.

- **Store**: one blob per campus, `hosp:<campus>` = `{buildings:[{id,name}], rooms:[{id,
  buildingId, name, style, notes, beds:[{id,label,out}]}], bookings:[{id, category, name,
  from, to, permanent, males, females, count, family, bedIds, notes, tripId}]}`. Starts
  empty — the team sets its rooms up in the app. Room styles: mixed, male, female,
  couple, family, guest, staff. Categories: guest, speaker, team, student, volunteer, staff.
- **A booking** holds `count` beds from `from` (first night) to `to` (the morning they
  leave — that night is free); a staff booking can be `permanent` (no `to`). `bedIds` may
  name fewer beds than `count`: capacity counts people, the picker only the named beds.
  `hospSave` refuses a named bed another booking holds on any shared night (`bed_taken`
  + `with`), a bed `out` of use, an unknown bed, and a second booking for the same team.
  Removing a bed from a room takes it out of every booking; a building with rooms, or a
  room someone is still booked into, can't be deleted.
- **Starting rooms**: Siem Reap reads `HOSP_SEED` (api.js) until its book is first saved — the
  Old Base (rooms 101–104, 201–205, 301–305, 401, 402) and Peace House (Units 1–7), with their
  bed letters and room types, taken from the base's rooms sheet. Layout only, **no names**.
- **Upload the rooms sheet** (Rooms tab, `hospImportHtml_`): the base's own "Rooms and Peoples
  in Base" sheet downloaded as CSV, read as it is (`hospSheetRows_`: "Room 102" blocks with
  their Bunk line and name / letter rows; family, couple and teacher rooms by their "Total:";
  Peace House "Unit N" rows). "(staff)" after a name → staff, others in a dorm → student,
  families → staff. A plain list with Building / Room / … headers is read too. The rows go
  to `hospImport`, which adds missing buildings, rooms and beds (matched by name) and puts
  each person in their bed from today, staying (permanent — now allowed for staff, students
  and volunteers); a family or couple room's rows with one name are one booking; a bed
  already held is skipped and reported. Importing twice adds nothing twice.
- **On a wide screen** the page takes the width (`main.wide`, set in `render()` for
  `S.view==='hosp'`): tiles four across, requests / bookings / bed-board rooms in columns
  (`.hospGrid`), room rows in columns (`.hospRoomGrid`). Phones are unchanged.
- **Team requests** are not stored: `getHospitality` lists every team in the Teams
  Database (`getTeamTrips_`) on the campus, not cancelled, with dates, not left yet —
  with `pending` from `pendingTeamIds_` and `bookingId` when a booking has its `tripId`.
  "Fits / Short by N" is worked out in the page (`hospFit_`: the tightest night of the
  stay against beds in use). Students aren't requests yet (no dates on the portal).
- **Guests and speakers ask from a link (Oct 2026)**: Requests has "🔗 Link for guests and speakers"
  (`hospStayLink_`, `#hospStayUrl`, Copy / Share) = `portal.html?stay=<campus>` — a short form with no account
  (`stayHtml_` / `bindStay_`: name, guest or speaker, arriving / leaving, men / women, phone or email, church
  or who invited them, notes; a hidden `website` box catches robots). `stayRequest(campus, p)` (public; dates
  from yesterday to two years ahead, up to 120 nights; 200 open per campus) keeps it in `stayReq:<campus>`;
  `hospRequests_` lists the open ones (`stayId`, `kind:'stay'`, `category`, contact, `org`, `notes`) with the
  teams — key `hospReqKey_` = 'sr:<id>'. Book beds fills the booking (category, counts, contact in the notes,
  `stayId`, one booking each); Decline (`hospStayStatus`) takes it off. Not in the portal's Applications.
- **A cancelled or deleted team with beds booked** (closed in the portal → its Teams Database row is
  cancelled; deleted in the portal → `portalDeleteApplicant` cancels the row; or cancelled / deleted in the
  Teams Database) is still listed by `hospRequests_` while its booking runs, as `cancelled: 'cancelled' |
  'deleted'` with `bookingId` and `count`. The booking is never removed on its own: Requests shows these
  first ("Cancelled — beds still booked") with **Free the beds** (`hospDelete` booking), the overview tile and
  tab badge count them, and the booking card is marked. Individual applicants never make requests.
- **Rights**: `canHosp_` — admins, and the Hospitality ministry: members (main or other
  ministry), its leaders, the Skills Training overseer. Not applicants, not inactive
  accounts. `getMyBoot`'s staff carries `hospitality`. Handlers: `getHospitality`,
  `hospSave(kind, rec)`, `hospDelete(kind, id)` with kind building | room | booking.
- `test-hospitality.mjs` (server) and `test-hospitality-page.mjs` (browser) cover it.
- **Calendar tab** has two views. *Calendar* (`hospCalHtml_`): one row per bed grouped by
  room, 14 days from a Monday (‹ › a week), each booking a bar over the nights it holds that
  bed (`cont` / `more` when it runs off the edge), bookings with beds still to pick stacked
  in "No bed yet" lanes, each day's % full in the header. It scrolls sideways inside
  `.hospCalScroll` with the bed column sticky. Tap a bar → the booking form.
  *Bed board* (`hospBoardHtml_`): the rooms on one night (‹ › a day, a date box), each bed
  with who is in it, and "No bed yet" chips for people without one. Tap a person, then a
  bed (or drag on a computer): `hospMoveBed(bookingId, fromBed, toBed)` moves them for the
  whole stay; onto someone sharing a night it **swaps** the two, refused (`bed_taken` +
  `with`) if that would put the other one in a third booking's bed; `fromBed` '' places
  someone waiting (`all_placed` when they all have beds); `toBed` '' takes them off.
  One write, so a swap can't half-happen.
  *Bed colours* (`hospBedSex_`, key `#hospBedKey` on the board and bed picker): men blue
  (`bed-m`), women pink (`bed-f`), couple / family green (`bed-fam`). A taken bed goes by the
  booking — `family`, else the named person's `sex`, else all-male / all-female counts —
  falling back to the room style (couple rooms green); a taken bed is filled solid with white
  text, a free one tinted with a coloured border, each with ♂ / ♀ / 👪; rooms carry a coloured
  style tag (`hospStyleTag_`).

## The hamburger menu, by role
`renderMenu` draws sections, and leaves out a section with nothing in it:
- everyone: **Base** (first — it left the bottom bar, Oct 2026), YWAM GP, Prayer, 360 reviews,
  **Leave Request**, **Library** (moved here from the bottom bar, Oct 2026; Profile & settings —
  with My contract inside it, `#profMyContract` — took its place in the bar); a guest's menu
  keeps Library / Create my profile / Log in;
- **Operations**: Weekly schedules (everyone), SR Hospitality (`canHospClient_`: the Hospitality
  ministry — members, leaders, the Skills Training overseer — and admins);
- **Applications**: YWAM GP Portal (admins, portal staff / portal admins, the Outreach Teams
  leader — `S.me.portal` from the server);
- **Admin**: HR (admins, or anyone given `hr`), Admin (admins).
Weekly Check-in is not in the menu (the Health tab is its home) and the GP Dashboard is hidden
for now. `test-menu.mjs` checks each role.

## Campus Leadership: the department pulse, the Director's quarter, staff debt from Finance
- **Department pulse** (`pulseCardHtml_` ← `getDeptPulse`): a department leader's own
  page leads with six figures and nothing to type — numbers in on time (numbers
  people), staff and who is away this week (approved/noted leave; names and dates,
  never reasons), the department's health score (see the exception under "Who sees
  what"), 1-on-1s accepted this month, OKR progress this quarter (client, `baseR`), and
  staff debt — with the ministries' done / not done list under it. The Campus
  Director gets one per department (lists folded). Their weekly typed numbers stay off.
- **The Campus Director's quarterly check-in is gone** (Oct 2026, Uriah: "Please remove q4
  check in. Not necessary"). It asked for Base Vision, Communications, Partner
  Relationships (1–10) and Base Plants in Planning once a quarter on the Board tab.
  Scores already saved stay in `entries`; Base Plants in Planning still counts itself
  from the plants list.
- **Staff debt from the Finance office** (`staffDebtCardHtml_`, `getStaffDebt` /
  `saveStaffDebt`): monthly, one box per department, on the Finances ministry page (its
  "The numbers" tab; since Oct 2026 an uploaded A/R ageing report fills it — see Finances),
  for Finances members/leaders and admins only (`canEnterStaffDebt_` — not the Skills
  Training overseer). Stored as it always was — `Staff Debt ($)` on each department's
  Campus Leadership row, with `by` — so everything reading it still does. Funds
  Raised is left alone (Uriah: don't worry about it).

## Finances: the office's three reports, and leadership's dashboard (Oct 2026)
Uriah: "Build the finance tool for the accounting ministry … build the finance page around
[our three reports] and then give all the leadership a base financial dashboard in their
ministry page." The three reports are the ones the Finances office (Skills Training →
Finances) already makes each month, as PDFs: QuickBooks' **Profit and Loss** (cash basis, a
column a month, "no RE and no KSS"), their **Burn Rate** spreadsheet (the campus and new
house's costs — rent, utilities, kitchen, technical, hospitality — and contributions —
teams, staff, students, rent from ministries — month by month, with the plan for the
months ahead, and the whole organisation's real income and spending, which match the P&L),
and QuickBooks' **A/R Ageing Summary** (staff debt by person and by 1/2/3/over-3 months).
- **Reading them** (`public/finance.js`, `GP_FIN`): pdf.js (`vendor/pdfjs/`, the legacy
  build, loaded the first time a PDF is picked, not precached) gives text with positions;
  `rowsFromItems` makes rows; `detect` / `parsePL` / `parseBurn` / `parseDebt`. Numbers are
  right-aligned but headings aren't, so the numbers' right edges are clustered into columns
  first, then matched to the headings (in order, or "the heading that starts before the
  column ends"). A P&L heading account's sub-accounts get `parent` from its "Total for …"
  line. A label pdf.js ran into its first number is pulled apart. Every report is checked
  against its own totals (`checks`), shown in the preview; a mismatch asks before saving.
  A tab-separated spreadsheet paste (`rowsFromTsv`) reads the same way.
- **The office's page** (My Ministry → Finances: **Reports** · Dashboard · The numbers,
  `gp-fin-tab`): add the PDFs (several at once) → a preview each (what was read, the checks,
  the cash in the bank at the month's end for a P&L, the year for a burn rate) → Save.
  Below: what is saved (open the PDF, change a month's cash, take one out), and the staff-
  debt names with "who is this?" for any not matched to staff.
- **The leadership dashboard** (`finDashHtml_`, the **Finances** tab on every Campus
  Leadership member's own row, and the office's Dashboard tab): a month picker; came in /
  went out / net / cash in the bank (vs last month); the year so far as columns (P&L months,
  or the burn rate's whole-organisation totals where there's no P&L — said so); where it
  went and came from (P&L lines rolled up to their top account); the campus and new house
  (cost to run vs contributions, % covered, the year's difference with the plan, each cost
  this month vs its 3-month average, planned months lighter); staff debt as totals; the
  money ahead. Charts are inline SVG on the `--viz*` tokens (validated with the dataviz
  checker, light and dark), with a tooltip per month (hover, tap, focus) and a table twin.
- **Store** (api.js): `finance:<campus>` = `{ pl: { 'YYYY-MM': { lines, cash, fileId, … } },
  burn: { 'YYYY': { sections } }, debt, debtHist, nameMap }`, each PDF `finfile:<id>`
  (replaced reports drop theirs). `getFinance`, `finSave` (kind pl/burn/debt, shapes checked,
  ≤4 MB PDF), `finSetCash`, `finMatchName`, `finDelete`, `finFile`, `finAheadSave`.
- **Who sees what.** Saving, fixing and deleting: the Finances office only
  (`finCanEdit_` = `canEnterStaffDebt_`: admin, Finances member or leader). The dashboard:
  them and everyone in Campus Leadership on that campus (`finCanView_`; an admin may pass
  another campus). **Staff debt never reaches leadership as a name or a person's amount** —
  `finDebtView_` sends totals, buckets, a count and per-department sums only; the rows, the
  name map and the ageing PDF are the office's alone (`finFile` refuses a `debt` file to
  anyone else). Debt stays between a person, their mentor and the office.
- **Names → staff → departments.** On save, each ageing name is matched to active staff on
  the campus (exact name; a couple, "A & B", counts to the first of them who is one person;
  a single first name if only one has it). The office's pick (or "Not on staff") is kept in
  `nameMap` by the spelling on the report, so next month needs nothing. The newest report
  then writes each department's `Staff Debt ($)` exactly as `saveStaffDebt` did (pulse and
  department pages keep working); an older report only fills `debtHist`.
- **The repo is public**: tests use made-up reports (`tests/fin-fixtures.mjs` writes real
  PDFs in the same layout); never commit the office's PDFs or their names.
- Tests: tests/test-finance.mjs (server), test-finance-parse.mjs (the parser),
  test-finance-ui.mjs (upload → preview → save → a Director's tab, no names on the page).

## QuickBooks: the P&L and the staff debt straight from the books (Oct 2026)
Uriah: "Can you build in interfaces where … this app can automatically connect to QuickBooks
and pull numbers from QuickBooks directly into the finance teams … without having to put them
in manually?" Two of the office's three reports come out of **QuickBooks Online** — the Profit
and Loss and the A/R Ageing Summary — so once connected those come in by themselves. The Burn
Rate is their own spreadsheet, not QuickBooks', so it's still uploaded. (QuickBooks Desktop
has no such connection; this is Online only.)
- **Setting it up (once, by an admin).** At developer.intuit.com: sign in with the Intuit
  account that owns the company, create an app (QuickBooks Online and Payments, scope
  **Accounting**), and under its Production settings add the Redirect URI
  `https://<the site>/.netlify/functions/quickbooks` exactly (and the app's EULA and privacy
  links, its host domain and launch/disconnect URL `https://<the site>/teams.html`; Intuit
  asks for these before it gives production keys). Then in Netlify → Site configuration →
  Environment variables: `QBO_CLIENT_ID` and `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET` (the production keys), and
  redeploy. Optional: `QBO_ENV=sandbox` with the Development keys to try it on Intuit's test
  company first; `QBO_REDIRECT_URI` if the site's address isn't Netlify's `URL`. **The keys
  never go in the repo, the chat or a commit.** Until they're set, the card says an admin
  must add them and nothing is called.
- **Connecting** (Finances → Reports, the QuickBooks card; the office only, `finCanEdit_`):
  `qboConnect` gives a random 48-hex `state` (in `gp-qbo` 'states', 15 minutes, single use,
  tied to the person and campus) and Intuit's sign-in URL; the page opens it in a window of
  its own (opened on the tap, so a phone doesn't block it). Intuit sends that window to
  `netlify/functions/quickbooks.js` → `qboCallback`: the state must be ours, unused and in
  time, its person still active and in the office; the code becomes tokens (the app's keys in
  a Basic header), the company's name is fetched, and the numbers come in at once. That page
  says how it went in English and Khmer (the app's own Khmer font), never echoing the request,
  with a way back. The app looks again when it's shown (`visibilitychange`, `S.qboWaiting`).
- **What comes in** (`qboSync_`; every night by `qbo-sync.js` at 04:15 Phnom Penh, after the
  backup, as the person who connected; and "Bring the numbers in now", `qboSyncNow`):
  - **P&L**: one report, `summarize_column_by=Month`, cash basis (like theirs), the twelve
    finished months to the end of last month. `qboPlFromReport_` gives the same lines an
    upload does: `sec` from the section's group (Income → inc, Other Income → oth, Expenses and
    Cost of Goods Sold → exp, Other Expenses → oexp), the account number split off the name, a
    heading account a line of its own with its sub-accounts' `parent`, and its own amount
    when QuickBooks gives it as a row of its own name. Each month goes through `finApplyPl_`
    (the upload's code): it replaces the saved month (an uploaded PDF for it is dropped), the
    cash typed for it stays; a month with nothing in it is left alone. `src: 'qbo'`.
    Each section is checked against QuickBooks' own total; a mismatch is kept (`warn`) and
    shown on the card.
  - **A/R Ageing**: as of today, QuickBooks' own buckets (Current, 1 - 30 …), every customer
    row (sub-customers too) that owes anything, through `finApplyDebt_` (the upload's code):
    names matched to staff and `nameMap`, each department's `Staff Debt ($)`. `debtHist` keeps
    one QuickBooks point a month (the latest), not one a night.
  - The **Locations and Classes** (two queries), for "Whose numbers are these?": if both
    campuses keep their books in one company, each office picks its own and the P&L is asked
    for with `department=` / `class=` (`qboSetFilter`, which brings the numbers in again).
    The ageing report can't be split that way; the other campus's names simply don't match.
- **Tokens.** Access tokens last an hour and are refreshed two minutes before; Intuit may hand
  back a new refresh token each time and it's kept at once. A 401 refreshes once and tries
  again. A refresh Intuit refuses (`invalid_grant` — disconnected from QuickBooks' side, or
  ~100 days unused) marks it `broken`: the card says to connect again, and the numbers
  already in stay. **Tokens live only in the `gp-qbo` store** (`conn:<campus>` = realmId,
  company, tokens, by, at, lastSync/lastTry/lastErr, warn, filter, lists) — not `gp-data`, so
  the nightly backup never copies them — and `qboOut_` never sends a token or the realm id:
  the office gets the company, when, who, the counts, any error, the filter and the lists;
  leadership only `{ connected, lastSync }` (their dashboard says "From QuickBooks · brought in
  …"). `qboDisconnect` revokes the refresh token at Intuit and deletes the connection; the
  numbers already brought in stay.
- **Tests**: tests/test-qbo.mjs (server) and tests/test-qbo-ui.mjs (the card), both against a
  stand-in Intuit (`tests/qbo-fixtures.mjs`: tokens, revoke, the P&L and ageing JSON, the
  queries) for one made-up company.

## Campus Leadership on My Ministry: OKRs and the Monday meeting board
Campus Leadership doesn't log weekly numbers (hidden for now). Its own row in the picker
("🧭 Campus Leadership", where My Ministry opens for anyone in Campus Leadership —
`mmSelected_` defaults to your own row) renders `leadSectionHtml_` instead of the dashboard /
week strip / input: two tabs.
- **Leadership OKRs** (`leadOkrDashHtml_`): this quarter's Campus Leadership objectives on the
  campus — tiles (quarter progress = mean `objProgress`, objectives, key results on pace with
  the week of the quarter, open meeting cards), each objective with its bar, its key results,
  and "N of M meeting cards done". Progress is still edited on the OKRs tab.
- **Monday meetings** (`leadBoardHtml_`): blob `leadBoard:<campus>` =
  `{cols:[{id,title,done}], areas:[{id,title}], standing:[{id,title}], cards}`. Defaults
  (`LEAD_DEFAULT`): columns Agenda / In progress / Done (Done is the finished one); focus areas
  Siem Reap finances, Siem Reap ministries, Construction; every-Monday agenda Department and
  ministry updates, Events coming up. A card: title, type (agenda | project), col, area, owner
  (staff id), due, notes, okrId (an objective's id — the card shows its progress). Moving into
  the finished column stamps `doneAt`; Done shows the last 30 days ("Show N older").
  "Edit the board" (`saveLeadSettings`) renames / adds / removes / reorders columns (exactly
  one finished; cards in a removed column go to the first), focus areas and standing items.
  Cards move by arrows, or drag on a computer. Handlers `getLeadBoard`, `saveLeadCard`,
  `deleteLeadCard`, `saveLeadSettings`; `canLead_` = Campus Leadership on the campus or admins.
- On a wide screen the section takes the width (`main.wide`), the columns side by side; on a
  phone they scroll across in their own row.
- `test-lead-board.mjs` (server) and `test-lead-board-page.mjs` (browser) cover it.

## Who's here (Oct 2026, Uriah)
Base's hero has **🏠 On campus now · N** (`#goWhosHere`, loaded by `whosHereLoad_` when Base
opens, kept 5 min) → the **Who's here** page (`S.view='whoshere'`, `whosHereHtml_`). Server:
`getWhosHere(user, pin, campus)` (staff only — not applicants, not guests): the campus's active
staff as ids, each `away:{type,to}` when an approved/noted trip or leave covers today (the page
dims them: "Off campus right now · On break / Serving off campus / Away"); and from
`hosp:<campus>` the bookings covering tonight (`from <= today < to`, or permanent) by kind —
teams (people from the portal: `teamPhotoPeople_` — leader, co-leaders, members), students,
volunteers, guests, speakers (names from `people` / `bedNames`, else the booking's name ×count).
`count` = staff here + everyone booked. Team photos load per team (`whosHereTeamPhotos`).
tests/test-whos-here-ui.mjs.

- **Capacity** (`beds`, `capacity` in getWhosHere): SR Hospitality's beds booked tonight (every booking,
  `max(count, bedIds)`) over its beds not marked out — "· 72% full" next to On campus now on Base and
  My Home, and "46 of 64 beds filled" on Who's here. No rooms set up → nothing shown.
- **My Home's card** has no big "Go to My Health" button: the My Health and Mentor rows carry a small ›
  (`.heroGo`) and open their pages; On campus now sits under the base's figures (`#goWhosHereHome`).
## The bottom bar (Oct 2026)
My Home · **My Ministry** · Team · Health · **Profile** (`data-tab`; My Ministry opens on its
Numbers view; Profile is Profile & settings, which holds **My contract** — its ← goes back to
Profile). **Base and the Library are in the ☰ menu** (Uriah, Oct 2026); My Home's card has a
plain **💚 Go to My Health** button (`#goMyHealth`) under its rows.
and its key figures sit at the foot of My Home's card. A guest's bar is Look around · Base ·
Team · Health · Library. Five tabs stay on one line down to 320px; where the full Khmer is
too long for a tab, `navLabel_` uses a short one kept as 'Tab: <English>' in km.js
(My Ministry → ការបម្រើ), and test-khmer checks no label overflows.

## My Home — the layout (reorganised Oct 2026)
`homeHtml` in this order, each idea said once: the **large summary card** (kept large on
purpose, with the background photo / colour option behind ⚙️ — it opens right under the
greeting, above the card, with a Done button: goals and their list,
Cooking / Chores, the streak, habits, My Health — `[data-gohealth]` opens the Health tab —
mentor and time off, then **the base at a glance** (`homeBaseHtml_`: the campus's staff,
base health score and salvations this year, from `baseR()` like Base's hero; tap → Base).
The Health check-in and My Ministry buttons left the card when both joined the bottom bar),
Updates (three at most, "See all" opens the bell), Weekly Goals (headed by the week itself, no 👀 line), Habits ("Show
streaks" inside the card), Annual goals (one card, `#goGoalsFromMe`, opens the Goals & Tasks page),
Mentorship ("You're mentoring" only for a mentor), About me (Personality and Strengths
tiles) and Leave / Profile & settings tiles. **Health and My Ministry have no section
below** — both are in the bottom bar (Uriah). OKRs are My Ministry's second tab.
- **Weekly Goals:** one card titled This week (or Last week / Next week); a small **Last week /
  This week / Next week** switch under the goals (`goalsWeekSwitchHtml_`, `data-goalswk`) — last
  week to mark how it went (no adding to a past week), next week to plan ahead (Oct 2026, Uriah:
  add up to three, edit or remove, no sliders or Mark Complete until it starts). Next week is
  offered up to week 51 (goals are kept per year as weeks 1–52).
  No week arrows, no "Share my week". An unlinked goal shows a quiet "Link to a KPI".
- Gone: the quick-jump chip strip and its scroll guard. tests/test-home-layout-ui.mjs
  holds the order.

## Hospitality bed picker: no over-booking (Oct 2026)
In the booking form's bed picker, once the booking has all the beds it needs
(`hospFormCount_`) every other free bed greys out (`.hospBed.full`, disabled, `#hospBedsFull`).
When **both** Men and Women are filled in, the men's rooms grey once their quota is picked and
the women's rooms once theirs (`#hospBedsQuota` says "Men's beds a of b · Women's beds c of d");
beds beyond men + women (the Beds box) can go in either. With only one of the two filled in,
nothing greys by gender — the "set for the other gender" warning does that job. Taken and
out-of-use beds are as before. tests/test-hospitality-page.mjs covers it.

## Hospitality bed picker: who sleeps where is in it (Oct 2026)
There is no separate "Who sleeps where" section any more. When a booking names people (a team
or a school, anything with a people list, or more than one bed — `hospNamesMode_`), tapping a
bed takes it and opens a chooser under the room (`#hospWho`, `S.hospBedPick`): the names the
room is for (`hospNamesForRoom_` — men in a men's room, women in a women's, anyone whose sex
is unknown in either; not-yet-placed first, placed ones dimmed with their bed), a typed-name
box (`[data-hbname]`, the datalist), Clear the name, Remove this bed, Done. Tapping a name puts
them in the bed (one bed each) and closes it. A selected bed shows its name, or "who?". A lone
guest's bed still just toggles. "Fill the beds in order" and "Not in a bed yet" stay above /
below the rooms. tests/test-hospitality-page.mjs covers it.

## Habits with a schedule (Oct 2026)
A habit row is `{id, mentorVisible, days?, label?, icon?}`: `days` is the weekdays it is due
(0 Sunday … 6 Saturday; absent = every day), and a habit of your own has id `c_<slug>` with
its `label` (40 chars) and `icon` (emoji, ⭐ by default) — `cleanHabitConfig_` in api.js,
`MAX_HABITS` 8 in both copies. The card (`habitsCardHtml`) asks only about what is due today
(`habitDue`, `myHabitsToday`), lists the rest under "n more on other days", and the hero
counts today's. Streaks walk the due days alone (`habitStreak`, `habitBest`) — a Mon/Wed/Fri
habit is not broken by a Tuesday. The picker has Every day / Weekdays / Pick days per habit
and an "Add your own" row. Ticking a tile pops confetti (`gpConfetti`, skipped under
prefers-reduced-motion). `habitMeta(hb)` takes the row (or an id) so custom labels show.
tests/test-habit-schedule.mjs covers the server rules and the page.

## Goals & Tasks (Oct 2026)
Annual goals open into their own page, `S.view==='goals'` (`goalsPageHtml`, back to My
Home), two tabs (`S.goalsTab`): **🎯 Goals** — year and category as before, "What is a
SMART goal?" folded (`SMART_HELP`: the five letters explained), each goal written out as a
SMART goal (`smart:{s,m,a,r,t}`, 300 chars each) with its **quarterly and monthly steps**
(`steps:[{id,kind:'quarter'|'month',period,title,done}]`, 24 at most) ticked off in place;
**✅ Tasks** — a Google-Tasks-like list, blob `tasks` (`{id,staffId,goalId,title,notes,due,
done,doneAt,order}`): add with Enter, tick off, a due date, a goal; Overdue / Today /
Upcoming / No date, Completed folded, Clear completed; chips filter by goal, "Other tasks"
for the unlinked.
- **Progress:** once a goal has steps or tasks, `pct` = ticked steps + done tasks over all of
  them (`smartPct_`); until then the typed percent (`pctManual`). The form hides the percent
  box once that is so. Every save sends the goal whole, steps included (`goalPayload_`).
- Handlers `getMyTasks` / `saveTask` / `deleteTask` / `clearDoneTasks` — own rows only; a
  task can only point at your own goal (anyone else's id saves as no goal). Deleting a goal
  leaves its tasks under Other tasks. Boot carries `tasks`; `saveTask` answers with tasks
  and goals both. The mentee view shows the same progress line.
- tests/test-smart-goals.mjs (server) and tests/test-goals-page.mjs (browser).

## My Home: no daily health inputs
The daily check-in (hours, mood, the private questions), the "This week" totals built from
daily logs, the days-logged health view and "Recent days" are removed — code and all (Uriah,
Oct 2026). The **Habit Tracker stays** as a personal daily tool (with its streaks under
"Load more") but feeds no score. The weekly health check-in on Health is the one check-in.

## National holidays are not leave
The base is closed on them, so a leave request over one spends none of the 30 days (nor
counts as outside or special). **Khmer New Year** and **Christmas week** come round on their
own: the Monday–Friday of the week 14 April / 25 December falls in (`HOLIDAY_RULES`,
`holidayWeek_`), any year. **Pchum Ben** follows the moon, so it is a dated list —
`HOLIDAY_DATED` until an admin saves one, then the `holidays` blob (`cleanHolidays_`: a name,
dates the right way round, at most a month each). `getTrips_` loads them
(`refreshHolidays_`) and `workDays_` leaves them out. **Work days are always counted from a
request's dates** (`tripWorkDays_`), never from the `workDays` stored when it was made — that
is what put every request already on file right when holidays arrived, and what recounts
everyone when an admin changes the list. `getMyTrips` / `adminListTrips` / a mentee's trips
carry `holidays` (last year to next) so the leave page lists them under the allowance and
counts a new request the same way (`leaveWorkDays_`, with a "… not counted" hint).
`test-holidays.mjs` and `test-holidays-page.mjs` cover it.

## Documents: every file at once (portal staff, Oct 2026)
On a record's Documents tab, a kind with more than one file (passports above all) has **👁 View all n**
— one full-screen page (`P.docGallery`, `#docGallery`, `docGalleryHtml_`) with every picture shown and
PDFs a tap away — and **⬇ Download all (.zip)**; the record has **All n documents (.zip)** with a folder
per kind. Files come one by one through `portalGetDoc` (`fetchDocs_`); the zip is made in the browser
(`makeZip_`, stored entries, CRC32, UTF-8 names) as "<Team> - Passports/1 - name.jpg"…, so it opens
as one folder.

## Our team (portal), Oct 2026
`portalMeetTeam` starts from the GP app's campus staff and YAP of the campus; a portal admin's
changes live in the portal only (`portalTeamCards` = `{cards:{<staffId>: {name, role, photo,
hidden}}, extra:[people added by hand]}`, `getTeamBlob_`). A role written there is shown exactly as
written — the GP app's ministry / department are not put beside it (`meetCard_`). `portalSaveStaffCard`
with id '' adds someone who isn't in the GP app (`pc_…`, `meetExtraCard_`, name needed, up to 60),
`{hidden:true}` hides a card from applicants (the admin still sees it, greyed), `{remove:true}` takes
an added person off, `{reset:true}` drops the portal's changes to a GP app person.

## Weekly schedules — the cooking schedule and the morning chores
Two schedules the base sends out every Sunday for the week ahead, made in the app and read
by everyone. **Cooking schedule** (`kitchen`, made by Skills Training › Culinary): a GRID of
rows (meal or chore, with a time and a Khmer name) × days; `cells['row|day']` is a list of
names, a `span` row (Pray – Announcements) has one `cells['row|all']`, `off` days are shaded.
**Morning chores** (`chores`, made by Skills Training › Hospitality): a LIST of sections
(Base, Family house) of places `{place, duty, people}`.

- **Store**: one blob per campus, `duty:<campus>` = `{kitchen:{weeks:{'YYYY-MM-DD' (the
  Sunday it starts): sched}, extras:[names typed by hand]}, chores:{…}}`, 60 weeks kept. A
  week holds its own rows, so changing one week never rewrites another. A week not made yet
  starts as a copy of the latest week before it, names and all, else from `DUTY_TEMPLATES`
  in api.js — **rows only, no names**: the repo is public, so the names on the paper sheets
  were never copied in. `cleanSched_` keeps a saved week to its kind's shape.
- **Handlers**: `getDuty(kind, week)` — the owning ministry (`canLogFor_`, admins too) gets
  the draft or a new week (`isNew`, `from`) plus `people` to pick from; anyone else only a
  published week. `saveDuty(kind, week, sched, action)` with action save (keeps its state) |
  publish | unpublish. `getMySchedules(week)` — this week's and next week's published ones
  for My Home, and `canEdit` per kind. Weeks are Sundays, Cambodia time (`dutyThisWeek_`).
- **Names on offer** (`dutyPeople_`): campus staff (staffType campus) by first name — two
  with the same first name get an initial (`dutyShortNames_`, mirrored by `schedMyName_` in
  teams.html) — then other staff, then every team in the Teams Database whose dates cover the
  week (its leader, co-leaders and `portal.members`), guests booked in SR Hospitality that
  week (not team bookings), then names typed in before. Staff on leave (any request not
  declined) for the whole working week of it are left out; partly away, they stay with
  `away[name]` = the days ("Tue, Wed"), shown on their chip in the picker (`dutyAway_`).
- **Pages**: `public/duty.js` (plain script, shared by teams.html and portal.html) draws a
  schedule (`dutyHtml`), finds your own cells (`dutyMine`), makes the picture (`dutyImage`,
  a white canvas sheet like the paper ones, after the Khmer font loads) and sends it
  (`dutyShare`: the share sheet with the PNG, else a download). teams.html: a small row in
  My Home's dashboard card (`schedHomeHtml_`: Cooking / Chores, dimmed until out, "You have N
  duties this week"), the menu's Weekly
  schedules, `S.view='sched'` (`schedHtml` / `bindSched_`): read, Share as image, and for
  the ministry Edit — tap a box for the name picker (search, groups, type a new name),
  "Change rows and days" / "Change places", Save draft, Publish, Take it down. My Ministry
  for Culinary / Hospitality has the way in (`#goSchedEdit`).
- **Portal**: a team lists its members (`portalSaveTeamMembers` → `portal.members`, name +
  man / woman; "👥 Your team members" card; staff see them on the record). Once the team has
  arrived they are on the schedules. Every applicant has a **📅 Schedule** tab (`AVIEWS`
  'schedule', `scheduleTabHtml_` / `schedPick_`): `portalBoot.schedules` (`applicantSchedules_`) =
  `{here, week, nextWeek, kitchen, chores, next:{kitchen, chores}, mine}` — published weeks only,
  and only while they are here (stage arrived, or a team whose dates take in this week or next);
  `mine` (their name, or the whole team's) is picked out. This week / Next week (once out),
  Cooking / Morning chores, Share as image; before they are here it says when it will show. View
  as applicant gets this week's real schedules. (Oct 2026: replaces the "This week at the base"
  card on the dashboard.)
- **Morning chores names (Oct 2026)**: in the list the names column is `fit-content(60%)` and names
  are joined with a space (the comma comes from CSS), so a name is never split and the next one goes
  underneath the rest instead of being cut off.
- **Oct 2026 (Uriah)**: names on the schedules are **full names** (`dutyShortNames_` now returns
  the full name; older weeks hold the first-name form, and `schedMyName_` answers both so
  `dutyIsMe_` matches either — `me` may be a list). **Campus staff and YAP are one group**
  ("Campus staff & YAP", id `campus`); ministry staff are "Other staff". The picker shows each
  name's **count** for the week (`schedAssignCounts_`, `.schedN`, 0 in green), fewest first;
  on the **morning chores** a name that already has a chore steps out of the list until
  everyone has one (`#schedAssigned` "x of N have a chore", `#schedShowAll` to see them all);
  the cooking hides nobody.
- `test-duty.mjs` (server) and `test-duty-page.mjs` (browser) cover it; the portal side is
  in `test-portal-page.mjs`.

## Admin — a home menu, one page per tool, one page per person
`adminHtml` routes on `S.adminSub`: `home` (a card per tool, `ADMIN_SUBS`, with counts on
Accounts, Approvals and Mentors), `accounts`, `approvals`, `mentors` (`adminMentorsHtml_`:
one campus at a time via `data-adminmentorcampus` chips opening on the admin's own, one card
per mentor with their people, `Waiting` until accepted, then everyone with no mentor —
read-only, the mentor is set on the person page), `leave` (`adminLeaveHtml_`: everyone's
leave from `adminListTrips`, one campus at a time + a year picker — waiting with Approve /
Decline via `adminDecideTrip` (admins may decide pending or `noted` requests, never one
already decided), away or coming up, days used per person against `PTO_ANNUAL_CAP`, the
national holidays (dated ones edited and saved with `adminSaveHolidays`), earlier
requests folded), `kpis`, `broadcast`, `merge`, and
`person` (`S.adminPersonId`). Every page has one back link, `#adminBack[data-adminback]`
— `week` (My Home), `home`, or `accounts`. **Accounts** is a campus chip row (opens on the
admin's own campus), the search (`#adminSearch`, kept in `S.adminSearch` so it survives a
rebuild, filter re-applied in `bind()`), and a list of tappable rows
`[data-adminperson="id"]`; tapping one opens the **person page**: who they are at the top,
then `adminRowBodyHtml_` (reset PIN, edit profile, mentor, admin access, danger zone) with
every id and data- attribute unchanged, so `bindAdmin()`'s handlers carry over. The old
layout — every tool behind a chip row, every account an accordion in one long list — is
gone; don't bring the accordions back (`adminAcc` in state is unused).

**Every staff record carries its own id, or gets one** (`ensureStaffIds_`, applied in
`getStaff_` and inside `mutateStaff_`): accounts from before the Netlify backend had none,
and with an empty id they all fell together — the list opened the wrong person, every
such account read as "(you)", and `adminResetPin` couldn't find them. A missing id is
minted on read, a duplicate re-minted for the LATER row, and the repaired list written
straight back. `test-staff-ids.mjs` covers it.

**The blob store is opened with `consistency: 'strong'`** (`store()`). Netlify Blobs
default to eventual reads, and `mutateStaff_` verifies a write by reading it back — under
eventual reads a good save compared unequal and came back `busy`, which the client shows
as "Could not save" (the leads / profile save in Admin). Don't drop the option.

`test-admin-select.mjs` drives the home → Accounts → person → back flow;
`test-admin-edit.mjs` the edit form and campus tabs; `test-admin.mjs` the server side.

## Human Resources (the HR page)
In the hamburger menu for an admin or anyone an admin has ticked **HR access** (`hr` on the
staff record, set via `adminUpdateStaff`, carried on boot as `staff.hr`; the item shows the
renewals-due count from boot's `hrDue`). `S.view==='hr'`, `hrHtml` / `hrPersonHtml_`,
bindings in `bindHr()`; the list loads on demand (`hrList`) with the same error card +
Try again as My Ministry.

- **A contract is for this base; time in YWAM is the person's**: `ywamSince` (a year,
  `ywamSinceOf_`, 1960..now) sits on the staff record, is set from the contract form through
  `hrSaveContract`'s payload (`ywamSince`; empty string clears, missing leaves it), and shows as
  "Started in YWAM in 2003 · 23 years in YWAM (anywhere in the world — e.g. their DTS)" above
  "With YWAM GP since Oct 2021 · 5 yr with YWAM GP" on the HR person page, and as "With YWAM GP
  5 yr · Started in YWAM 2003" in the list (Oct 2026, Uriah: Naomie did her DTS in 2018 but started
  with YWAM GP in Oct 2021). Time with YWAM GP counts from the **contracts**: a campus's start is
  the month HR set, else its earliest contract signed — never the profile's year (`p.joined`,
  labelled "Year I started with YWAM GP (not your DTS year)"), which people filled with their DTS.
  No contract and no month set: the line asks for the first contract. Someone can be 23 years in YWAM
  on a 2-year Siem Reap contract; the contract's `years` still drives the renewal date.
- **Admin → Accounts and HR → Everyone group a campus's people by kind of staff** (`staffGroups_`, shared; `[data-admingroup]` / `[data-hrgroup]`): "{Campus}
  ministries" (`staffType==='ministry'`), then "YAP and Campus staff" (`yap` / `campus`), then
  "Kind of staff not set yet" for anyone unsorted — each a `[data-admingroup]` with a
  `.mentorLabel` heading and count; the search hides a group whose rows all miss.
- **Contracts live on the staff record**: `contracts: [{id, signed:'YYYY-MM', years,
  notes, files:[{id,name,mime,size,added}], added, addedBy}]`, sorted oldest first; the
  **current** contract is the last one, a renewal is another row (`hrSaveContract`; same
  id = edit in place). A contract **ends on the first day of the month `years` after the
  month signed** (`hrContractEnd_`, both sides); status = archived / no contract / expired
  / renew soon (≤ `HR_DUE_DAYS` = 90) / active. Years served count from the earliest
  contract's month, else the profile's `joined` year.
- **Attachments are their own blobs** (`hrfile:<id>` = {name, mime, data:base64}); the
  staff record holds only the meta. PDF or image, ≤ ~4 MB (`HR_FILE_MAX_B64`). Deleting
  a file or its contract drops the blob (`hrDropFile_`). The client opens one by turning
  the data URL into a Blob URL (`hrOpenDataUrl_`) — a data: URL can't be a top-level page.
- **Archiving IS deactivating**: `hrArchive` sets `active:false` plus `archived:{at,
  reason, by}`, so the roster, the staff count, sign-in and the mentor pickers all follow
  with no extra work; `hrUnarchive` reverses it. The admin's Approvals page and its home
  badge count `!active && !archived` — an archived person is not a sign-up. Nobody
  archives themselves.
- **Every server test copies `team-seed.js` next to `api.js`** (api.js imports it).
- Later this page grows into processing potential staff and volunteers (the CRM side);
  keep the person page as the unit.
- **Candidates** (the CRM side, second tab `S.hrTab==='cands'`): potential staff /
  volunteers / students in the `candidates` blob — `{id, campus, name, type, stage, subtype,
  school, email, phone, country, source, assignedTo, nextStep, nextDate, expected, notes,
  staffId, log:[{at,by,kind:'stage'|'note',text}], archived}`. Stages `new → contacted →
  applied → interview → accepted → arrived` (`CAND_STAGES`, both sides); a stage change is
  logged by the server (`hrSaveCandidate`), notes append (`hrCandidateNote`), archive is a
  flag with a reason (`hrArchiveCandidate`, `null` to unarchive) — nothing is deleted. A
  next step with a date within `CAND_FOLLOWUP_DAYS` (7) counts as a follow-up due: boot's
  `hrFollowUps`, the Candidates tab, the menu badge (contracts due + follow-ups due).
  On `arrived`, the record can point at a staff account (`staffId`) and jump to their
  contracts page. Contact details and contract dates are personal data — never seed them
  from a file in this public repo (the old-CRM pre-fill was removed for that reason).
- **Bell reminders** (`notifItems_`): for an admin or anyone with HR, "N staff contracts
  are due for renewal" and "N candidate follow-ups are due", each with an **Open HR**
  button (`data-gohr`, bound in `renderNotifPanel` and in `bind()`). They are dated *today*,
  not *now*, so Clear hides them until tomorrow and they come back while the work waits.
- `test-hr.mjs` / `test-hr-candidates.mjs` (server) and `test-hr-page.mjs` /
  `test-hr-candidates-page.mjs` (browser) cover it.

## YWAM GP Portal (public/portal.html)
The application portal for YWAM Siem Reap — students (DTS, DBS, BCS, SMS), potential
staff, volunteers and short-term teams apply and follow their application; the
applications department works the same records as a CRM. Plan, milestones, URL and
deep links: **`docs/portal-plan.md`**. Milestone 1 is built (accounts, roles, the
access screen, the applicant dashboard shell with the timeline, a first staff view);
forms, documents and references follow.

- **Sign-in (Oct 2026): Google or email + password for applicants; staff keep username + PIN.**
  An applicant's **username is their email**. `createApplicant_` takes one of three:
  `{googleToken}` (a Google ID token — `verifyGoogleToken_` asks Google's tokeninfo and checks
  `aud` = `GP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, verified email, not expired; the name and email are Google's),
  `{email, password}` (8–200 chars, PBKDF2 in `secretHash`/`secretSalt`, `hashSecret_`), or the
  older `{username, pin}` (portal admins adding by hand). A Google account has no password: the
  server mints a **device token** (`addDeviceToken_`, 48 hex chars, hashed in `rec.tokens[]`, up
  to 8) that the page keeps as its "pin" — so every handler's `(username, pin)` is unchanged;
  `credOk_` is the one place PIN / password / token are checked (used by `verifyStaff_` and the
  staff login's re-checks). Handlers: `portalAuthConfig` (is Google on — the page draws the
  button only then), `portalLoginGoogle` (token → boot + `user` + `token`; `err:'new'` with the
  email and name when there is no account yet, `err:'staff'` for a staff email),
  `portalSetPassword` (own, applicants; on an older username + PIN account it also makes the
  email the username — the dashboard's "Switch to email and password" — and answers `user`).
  `portalRegister` answers `user` and `token` too.
  `portalMeOut_` / `portalAccountOut_` carry `authKind` google|password|pin;
  `portalUpdateAccount` sets `newPassword` on an email account (`newPin` → `no_pin_account`,
  username → `username_is_email`; changing the email moves the username with it).
  **Set `GP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` on Netlify** (a Web OAuth client in Google Cloud with the portal's
  origin as an authorised JavaScript origin); without it the sign-in is email + password only.
  Page: `loginHtml_` (our own black **Continue with Google** button, `googleBtnHtml_` / `googleGo_` —
  Google's drawn button carries a white box on the dark page — over the GIS OAuth token client,
  `gsiLoad_`, `onGoogleCred_`; the server takes an access token or an ID token; email +
  password, "Staff, or a username and PIN?" → `P.pinLogin`), `registerHtml_` (password boxes, or
  "Signing up with Google" when `P.gtoken`), `signIn_`, `savePassword_` (the dashboard's contact
  card shows how you sign in and Change password). There is no email sending, so a forgotten
  password is reset by a portal admin on Accounts.
- **The portal installs as an app**: `portal-manifest.json` (its own `id`/`start_url`), the same
  `sw.js` (portal.html, its manifest and outreach-guide.js are in the shell, `gp-shell-v2`),
  `installCardHtml_` on the dashboard (the browser's install prompt where there is one, the
  Share → Add to Home Screen hint on iPhone, dismissable, gone once installed). The portal is
  meant to be the first door into the community — an account a student keeps through their
  time here; staff / volunteer applications from inside it (landing in HR) are the next step.
- **The portal as a tool (Oct 2026)**: an applicant's dashboard has four tabs on top
  (`applicantNavHtml_`, `P.aview`): 📋 Application (`meHtml_`), 👥 Meet our team
  (`portalMeetTeam` — the campus's campus-staff **and YAP as one list, "YWAM <Campus> Campus
  Staff"**; name, role, ministry, department only; photos one at a time via
  `portalStaffPhoto`, `loadStaffPhotos_`), 🧭 Team strengths (the staff app's questionnaire —
  `personality.js` is loaded by portal.html — taken by each person on the team, the same keys as
  the photos, or `me` for a lone applicant; blob `tpers:<candidateId>`; `portalStrengths` /
  `portalSaveStrength` {type, scores, source test|picked} / `portalDeleteStrength`; the page shows
  each result, the four groups and the E/I S/N T/F J/P balance) and 📚 Resources
  (`portalResources` — a list a portal admin edits on the staff side's Resources tab,
  `portalSaveResources`, blob `portalResources`, kinds guide|link|phone|note,
  `PORTAL_RESOURCES_DEFAULT`: the Outreach Leader's Guide, the teams booklet, 117/118/119, the campus
  address and the places list (Google Maps), and kind `app` — Grab, PassApp, foodpanda — drawn with
  the app site's favicon via Google's s2 service (`appLogoHtml_`, 📱 fallback) and a Get it link.
  A saved list is merged with the shipped one on read (`mergeResources_`): items shipped later are
  appended, ids the admin removed stay out (`dropped`, written on save), an empty saved value takes
  the shipped one). tests/test-portal.mjs and test-portal-page.mjs cover all four.
  The heading is `'{campus} Campus Staff'` — `campusName_` already says YWAM, so never prefix it
  again. **Our team, staff side** (portal admins; nav `toTeam`, `P.view==='team'`,
  `teamAdminHtml_` / `bindTeamAdmin_`): the same cards with Edit — name, role and photo go
  through `portalSaveStaffCard(user, pin, staffId, {name?, role?, photo?})`, portal-admin only and
  only for the cards applicants see (`meetStaffOk_`: campus/yap of the admin's campus). **It never
  writes the GP app's staff record**: the GP app seeds the card and the portal's changes sit on top
  in blob `portalTeamCards` {cards: {staffId: {name?, role?, photo?}}} (`meetCard_(r, ov)`,
  `meetPhoto_`; `edited` flag; `{reset:true}` drops them). Photo as a jpeg data URI from
  `shrinkPhoto_(file, 384)`, '' to remove. **View as applicant shows every tab**: `portalViewAs`
  carries `strengths` (and a sample team has two sample members), `previewHtml_` swaps
  `P.aview/strengths/tphotos` in with the boot and draws `applicantNavHtml_('data-pvaview')`
  outside the inert frame (`P.pv.aview`); Our team and Resources load with the staff member's own
  creds (`meetOn` / `resOn` in `bindTabs_`).
- **A team that left archives itself (Oct 2026)**: `sweepLeftTeams_` runs on every `portalBoot` (Phnom Penh
  date, `pnpToday_`): a team at stage `arrived`, not archived, without `archiveOff`, whose last date in
  Cambodia (`teamLeaves_`: latest itinerary `to`) has passed gets `archived = {at, by:'auto', left}` and a
  log note. Nothing is removed (docs, photos, strengths, numbers stay). `archived.left` means: status
  `completed` ("Outreach complete", a thank-you note), `tripFromApp_` keeps the Teams Database entry
  `active` (only a hand-closed team is `cancelled`), and `applicantCand_(…, leftOk)` still lets
  `portalSaveTeamNumbers` through. Reopening it by hand sets `archiveOff` (kept by `cleanCandidate_`) so the
  sweep leaves it. Page: the Teams tab's chip reads 🗄 Archive and groups by year (`<details
  class=archYear>`, newest open) and quarter (`.archQ`, `archDate_` = left or at, `QUARTER_MONTHS`); the
  record shows `#archBanner`.
- **Portal on phones and desktops (Oct 2026)**: the staff list/record grid is `minmax(0,1fr)` with
  `.crm > * { min-width:0 }` — before, a long line in a record (its tabs, a chip row) stretched the column
  to ~570px on a 360px phone and the page slid sideways, cutting things off. The header title wraps beside
  the language / sign-out buttons under 420px (`.hbtns` never shrinks), roster names wrap instead of `…`,
  and on screens ≥1200px the Applications page (`body.wideStaff`) widens to 1400px for the list beside a
  record. Tests: "fits a phone" in test-portal-page.
- **Legal documents look like the paper (Oct 2026)**: every document (signing screen, the admin's Read it
  preview, the signed PDF) has the YWAM Siem Reap letterhead (`public/letterhead.jpg`, also inlined as
  `LETTERHEAD_JPEG` in legal-pdf.js so the function needs no file read) and the title centred. Headings that
  start "1. " are numbered sections, a size down from the Part headings; a list item "Lead: text" gets a bold
  lead-in; a paragraph with `style:'quote'` is set off with a bar. Portal: `legalHeadHtml_`, `legalHHtml_`,
  `legalListHtml_`, `legalReadHtml_` (read-only, every block type).
  The Child Protection Agreement has a box to tick after each Part and each numbered commitment (`readA`…`readF`,
  `c1`…`c8`), so people tick as they read; every box is needed to sign (`unticked`).
- **My contract & staff signing (Oct 2026)**: ☰ → My contract (`S.view='mycontract'`, `myContractHtml` /
  `bindMyContract_`, server `myContract`) — every staff member's own HR profile, read-only except their start
  dates (`mySaveStart`, same rules as HR's via `applyStart_`): time in YWAM and on each campus, their contracts
  and when the current one ends, and the legal documents. HR itself stays HR/admin-only. They sign on
  `portal.html?staff=1[&doc=<id>]`, which reads the GP app's saved sign-in (`gp-staff`) and uses
  `staffSignOpen` / `staffSignSubmit` (same screens and rules as applicants: `signRecord_` is shared), then
  links back to `teams.html?view=mycontract`. Records: `staff.legal[docId]`, blob `ssign:<staffId>`. Forms
  they signed as an applicant in the portal (their application by staffId or the same email, signed as 'me';
  never a team's) are copied in by `syncPortalLegal_` as `{from:'portal', candId}`; `hrLegalPdf` reads those
  from the portal's blob. The Child Protection Agreement is on everyone's Required list (`requiredFor_`
  item `legal:child`). The "Finish your profile" card (papers HR asks everyone to sign) is at the top of My
  contract (`reqMyContractCardHtml_`), not on My Home; a paper's page goes back to My contract.
- **Staff contract, filled out in person (Oct 2026, Uriah)**: only HR/admin opens the Volunteer Staff Contract
  (`STAFF_CONTRACT`, `sign.leader`). On someone's HR profile, **Fill out staff contract** — any time, also to
  redo a paper contract (it starts from that contract's month and years) — picks the period and calls
  `hrSendContract` (one waits at a time, `digital.status` awaiting_staff; starting again changes its period;
  returns `contractId`), then opens `portal.html?staff=1&hr=<staffId>&doc=contract:<id>` on HR's own phone
  (`hrContractOpen` / `hrContractSign`, HR only, `hrContractGate_`). The person reads, fills in and signs;
  HR signs under "Approved by" (name prefilled from `approver`; `leaderName` + `leaderSig` required, else
  `leader_required`) → signed at once, `approvedBy`, blob `scontract:<id>`.staff; the page goes back to
  `teams.html?view=hr&hr=<staffId>`. Staff never sign the contract themselves (`staffSignOpen` /
  `staffSignSubmit` are only the legal documents) and My contract lists only contracts in force. Only a
  signed contract counts (`contractInForce_` / `hrInForce_`); `contractState_` adds `soon` (≤ HR_DUE_DAYS),
  which drives the My contract notice on My Home (`contractNoticeHtml_`). The HR list (`hrHtml`) defaults to
  **By contract end** (`hrByEnd_`: run out the longest ago first, then renew soon, then by end, no contract at
  the bottom) with **By ministry** as the old grouping, and filter chips (`HR_FILTERS_`, `hrFilterHas_`):
  All, Expired, Renew soon, Current, No contract, Paper only (current contract not yet digital); each row
  says 📄 Paper or ✍️ Digital. PDFs: `hrLegalPdf`, `hrContractPdf` (HR, or the person for their
  own — a contract only from their own record).
- **Legal documents, signed on a phone (Oct 2026)**: YWAM Siem Reap's five forms (Photo Release, Accident
  Waiver, Liability Release Waiver, Acceptance of Place, Child Protection Agreement) live in `netlify/functions/legal-docs-default.js`
  as blocks (p / check / group / field / initial) with `sign {age, witness, guardian}` — English, verbatim
  from the paper forms (every document's own words have Khmer — the five team documents and the Volunteer Staff Contract — in `public/legal-km.js`; tests/test-khmer.mjs fails if a line has none, `LEGAL_KM` keyed by the English line, shown through `lk_` / `lkPeriod_` when the portal is in Khmer; the signed record and PDF keep the English; Claude's translation, not yet reviewed). Staff make a team's link on the record's ✍️ Legal
  tab (`portalSignLink`, token hashed as `portal.signLink.hash`, a new one turns the old off); anyone opens
  `portal.html?sign=<token>` with no account (`P.view==='sign'`, `signHtml_` / `bindSign_`; a saved sign-in
  is not booted), picks their name (`teamPhotoPeople_`), says if under 18, and signs each document:
  ticks, lines, initials and signatures drawn on `.sigPad` canvases (`bindSigPads_`, saved as JPEG
  base64 in `P.sign.pads`). `portalSignSubmit` checks everything and keeps the record per person in blob
  `tsign:<candId>:<key>` plus a snapshot of the exact text (`legalSnap:<sha256>`); the candidate keeps only
  `portal.signed[key][docId] = {at, name}` for the grid. `portalSignedPdf` builds the PDF on demand with
  `netlify/functions/legal-pdf.js` (hand-written PDF: Helvetica WinAnsi text, ticks, the JPEGs, a footer).
  A portal admin switches documents on/off on ✍️ Legal documents (`portalLegalDocs` /
  `portalSaveLegalDocs`, blob `legalDocs {off, contacts}` — the Child Protection Agreement's Part F reporting
  contacts). Every kind of applicant signs (`signPeople_`: a team's people, else just `me`), and from their own
  dashboard once at `practical`/`arrived` (`legalCardHtml_` → `openMySign_`): the sign handlers take
  `{user, pin}` in place of a token (`signFor_`), so the team link staff sent keeps working. Block kinds also
  include h / list / choice (one of; `choices`) / contacts, and fields can be `optional` or `prefill`
  (role, dates from `signPrefill_`). Choosing "disclose privately" on the agreement logs a note on the
  record and flags `portal.signed[key].child.disclose`. Every test that copies api.js copies both new files too.
- **The staff record in tabs (Oct 2026)**: `panelHtml_` keeps contact on top, then a sticky tab row
  (`#ptabs`, `[data-ptab]`, `P.ptab`, reset to overview per record via `P.ptabFor`): Overview (stage,
  owner, next step, team steps) · Trip · People · Documents (visa + docs + reference) · Numbers · Answers ·
  Notes, only the tabs a record has; the actions sit in `.panelFoot`. Only the open tab is drawn, so a test
  calls `ptab(page, id)` before reaching into one. Answers fold per form section (`.ansFold`, first
  open, answered/asked) with `#ansQ` Find in answers (`answersHtml_(…, {fold, q})`, `answerText_`).
- **Rooms booked (teams, Oct 2026)**: a team step `rooms` (after the visa steps, who: us,
  `side: true` — it can tick any time, so it is never the current step). Done when SR
  Hospitality has a booking for the team's trip: every write of `hosp:<campus>` goes through
  `saveHosp_`, which runs `syncTeamRooms_` → `cand.portal.rooms = {beds, from, to}` (null when
  there is none); opening SR Hospitality (`getHospitality`) catches up teams booked before.
  The portal shows "🛏 12 beds · dates" under the ticked step (`roomsLine_`), staff see the same
  in Team steps. Students and other single applicants have no booking link yet.
- **E-visa how-to and supporting documents (Oct 2026)**: once a team's letter of invitation is
  uploaded (or "Letter of invitation sent" is ticked — `visaOpen_` in api.js, `app.visaOpen`), a
  drop-down **How to apply for your e-visa online** (`visaHowHtml_`, `#visaHow`) opens under the
  e-visa step in Where you are: the letter (`data-docopen`), the supporting documents
  (`data-visadoc`), what the e-visa form asks about us with Copy (`data-copytext`), the steps
  (`VISA_HOW`) and Preparing to come. Teams no longer get the separate visa card; individuals get
  the same drop-down inside theirs. Portal admins keep it under ☰ → 🛂 E-visa info
  (`visaAdminHtml_`, view `visa`): blob `visaInfo:<campus>` = {info:{org,address,phone,email,extra},
  docs:[{id,name,mime,size,parts}]}, defaults in `VISA_INFO_DEFAULT`. Supporting documents are big
  scans, so they go up and come down in ≤3 MB base64 parts (`portalVisaDocPart` in order, part 0
  starts it, the last lists it; `portalVisaDocGet` per part; blobs `vdoc:<id>:<n>`). Readers:
  portal/HR staff, or an applicant for their own campus once `visaOpen_` (`not_yet` before);
  writers: portal admins. The real PDFs (tax certificate, MOU, licence) are uploaded in the portal,
  never committed. Staff Overview shows "Next for us: the letter of invitation" (`#invNudge`) with a
  button to Documents. **Your team members** and **Documents** are folding cards
  (`foldCardHtml_`, `P.fold`): members open only while empty, Documents only while something is
  missing.
- **Call notes (teams, Oct 2026)**: a 📞 Call notes tab on team records (`panelCallsHtml_`,
  `bindCalls_`, draft in `P.call`) for what was said on calls with the leaders: date, who was on
  the call (starts as the leader), notes (≤5000, line breaks kept), newest first. Stored as
  `calls` [{id, date, with, text, by, at, edited, editedBy}] on the candidate, written ONLY by
  `hrCandidateCall(user, pin, candId, {id?, date, with, text} | {id, remove:true})` (HR / portal
  reach as for notes; edit and delete by the writer or a portal admin). `hrSaveCandidate` keeps
  `calls` from the stored record, and `portalAppOut_` never sends them to the applicant.
- **Staff side bar and menu (Oct 2026)**: above the bar, a small text link "← Go back to GP Home"
  (`#toGpApp`, `.gpHomeLink` — Uriah kept tapping the old ‹ button by mistake); the bar is one ☰ button
  that says where you are (`staffNavHtml_`, `P.menuOpen`, `#navMenu`, `.menuHere`); the portal opens on
  Applications, which is the first item in the menu (`#navCrm`). The menu is a drawer that
  slides in from the right over a backdrop (`#staffMenu` fixed, `#menuScrim`, `body.menuOn`; ✕, the
  backdrop or Esc close it — a test that opens it must close it before clicking the page) with Applications, then two groups — Staff
  access (View as applicant, Link for applicants) and Admin access (Forms, Accounts, Our team,
  Resources, Who has access). The ids (`toForms`…) are unchanged, so tests open the menu first when
  a button is missing. **Who has access** (`P.view==='access'`, `accessHtml_` / `bindAccess_`): every
  active staff member from `portalAccessList` (portal admins) with Staff access / Admin access
  checkboxes that call `portalSetAccess`; only a GP app admin can switch admin access
  (`canGrantAdmin`), and GP app admins / Outreach Teams leaders are marked as having it anyway.
  **Teams tab order** (`teamOrder_`, `teamTrip_`): here now, then soonest to come, then no dates
  yet, then already gone; every other tab stays latest change first.
- **A team's photos (Oct 2026)**: instead of one team photo with names, the leader takes a photo
  of each person in the portal — `teamPhotoPeople_(c)` is the leader (from the form), the
  co-leaders (`co|<n>`) and every member (members now carry an `id`, kept through a rename —
  `cleanMembers_`). Photos live in one blob per team, `tphotos:<candidateId>`, by key, as
  small JPEGs the page shrank (`shrinkPhoto_`, 480px square; `TEAM_PHOTO_MAX_B64`). Handlers
  `portalTeamPhotos` / `portalSaveTeamPhoto` / `portalDeleteTeamPhoto` (the team, or staff via
  `docCand_`). `teamPhotoTally_` keeps `portal.photos {count,total}` on the record so
  `photosDone_` → `hasPhotoDoc_` can mark the team-photo document in without opening the blob
  (`teamDocsIn_`, the `photo` step). The team never sees the `photo` kind as a document
  any more (`meHtml_` filters it out — the names and photos live under Your team members and the
  timeline step ticks itself). Staff still see it on the record, for photos a team sent as files:
  `uploadsForRosterHtml_` lists the image uploads of that kind under the roster with a guess at who
  each is from the file name (`guessPerson_`), and Use fetches the file (`portalGetDoc`), shrinks it
  (`shrinkPhoto_`) and saves it as that person's photo (`portalSaveTeamPhoto` with the candidateId)
  — how YWAM Montana's uploads, made before the roster existed, go onto their people. A photo
  made that way remembers its upload (`fromDoc`), so the file is not offered again; and once
  everyone has a photo (`rosterDone_`) the uploads block and the staff record's `photo` document
  row are hidden — the roster is the one place. Page: `rosterHtml_` on the applicant's members card and the
  staff record (`panelMembersHtml_`), `bindRoster_`, and `teamSheet_` — a canvas with every face
  and name for the staff group chat (`#teamSheetBtn`, shared via `dutyShare`).
- **Country fields** have a search box (`countryFieldHtml_`, `bindCountrySearch_`): typing
  filters the select underneath and a single match picks itself.
- **Forms feel**: `SECTION_ICON` by section id, a "Nice — next: …" nudge after Next,
  `portalConfetti_` on a first submit.
- **An applicant is a staff row with `kind:'applicant'`** (`portalRegister`: username +
  PIN, name, email, phone and messenger ∈ whatsapp|telegram required, type ∈
  `PORTAL_TYPES`, campus ∈ `PORTAL_CAMPUSES` — Poipet runs DTS + DBS, Siem Reap all four — and
  for students a school that campus runs, else `school_not_at_campus`) plus
  `applicant:{type, school, candidateId}`. Their application IS a candidate record in the
  `candidates` blob (`source:'portal'`, `staffId` → the account, `messenger`,
  `portal:{createdAt, submittedAt, form, docs, references}`). `cleanCandidate_` carries
  `messenger` and `portal` through a CRM edit untouched.
- **Fail closed, in one place**: `verifyStaff_(u, pin, allowApplicant)` answers null for
  an applicant unless the handler passes `true` (`portalBoot`, `portalUpdateContact`).
  So every staff handler — boot, logs, goals, HR, admin — is closed to applicants without
  a check of its own; `staffLogin` answers `err:'applicant'` and teams.html sends them to
  the portal. Applicants are filtered out of `teamRoster`, both boot rosters, `getData`'s
  roster, `adminListStaff`, `hrList` and `staffProfile` (`isApplicant_`).
- **Portal access is a flag, never automatic**: `portalStaff` (see and work every
  applicant) and `portalAdmin` (that, plus granting portalStaff). `canPortal_` /
  `isPortalAdmin_`; an app admin has both. Set on **Admin → Portal access**
  (`adminPortalHtml_`, `data-portalstaff` / `data-portaladmin` ticks → `adminUpdateStaff`)
  or the person page's edit form; from inside the portal via `portalSetAccess` (a portal
  admin may set portalStaff, only an app admin portalAdmin; never on an applicant).
  `hrGate_` admits portal staff, so the CRM handlers (`hrSaveCandidate`,
  `hrCandidateNote`, `hrArchiveCandidate`) are the staff side's writes. Boot carries
  `staff.portalStaff` / `portalAdmin`, and the hamburger menu shows **YWAM GP Portal**
  (opens portal.html in a new tab) to anyone with access.
- **Scope by ministry** (`portalTypes_` / `portalMaySee_`): an Outreach Teams portal staff
  member sees team applications only — `portalBoot` filters and returns `scope:['team']`,
  and `hrSaveCandidate` / `hrCandidateNote` / `hrArchiveCandidate` refuse anything outside
  the scope for a non-HR caller (creating one included). Everyone else with access sees
  all kinds. The staff list's tab row (`.whatTab[data-whatfilter]`, All · DTS · DBS · BCS ·
  SMS · Staff · Volunteer · Teams with counts) shows only the tabs in scope.
- **The Outreach Teams leader gets in without a tick** (`leadsTeams_`). Anyone whose `leads`
  include `Community Service|Outreach Teams` passes `canPortal_`, and is scoped to team
  applications unless they are also ticked Portal staff. Making someone that ministry's leader
  (Admin → Accounts) is the grant. Admin → Portal access says so on their row
  (`[data-teamsleader]`). `getMyBoot` sends `staff.portal`, so the menu shows the portal link
  to them too.
- **The application forms** live in data: `netlify/functions/portal-forms-default.js` (one
  form per key — dts/dbs/bcs/sms/staff/volunteer/team; sections → questions with `{en,km}`
  labels, a type, required, options, and an `audience` of all / khmer / international)
  is the shipped set — the DTS form (`dtsForm`) mirrors the base's own GP DTS Application
  Google Form (its Khmer is a fresh translation for review; the source PDF's Khmer was
  unreadable), the other schools share `studentForm`; a portal admin's edits (`portalSaveForm`, Google-Forms-style editor
  on the staff side, `formsHtml_`) are stored per key in the `portalForms` blob and
  `getForms_` lays them over the defaults (`isDefault` marks an unedited one;
  `portalResetForm` drops the stored copy). **Every server test copies this module next to
  api.js**, like team-seed.js. Answers are keyed by question id (`cleanAnswers_` keeps
  only questions asked of that audience). The applicant fills it section by section
  (`formHtml_`, `P.answers`, draft autosave via `portalSaveDraft`), `portalSubmit`
  checks required for their audience (`missingRequired_`) and moves stage new → applied.
  Staff read the answers on the record and correct them (`portalStaffSaveAnswers`, logged).
  After submitting, the applicant can still **edit their own answers** (`portalUpdateAnswers`:
  whole answer set, required re-checked, logged "Updated their application answers", stage
  untouched; the dashboard's "Edit my answers" reopens `formHtml_` in update mode — no
  autosave, "Save changes" on every section). Teams apply with estimated dates and head
  counts and firm them up this way; the team form's help text says so.
- **Accounts (staff side, portal admins only, `accountsHtml_`)**: every applicant account
  in one list — applicant accounts are not in Admin → Accounts, so this is their one
  place. `portalListAccounts` (no PIN material), `portalCreateApplicant` (same
  `createApplicant_` as sign-up, `createdBy` = the admin), `portalUpdateAccount` (name,
  username, email, phone, messenger, country, optional new 4-digit PIN; unique username /
  email; the CRM record's contact facts follow; refuses staff accounts with
  `not_applicant`), delete = `portalDeleteApplicant`. Portal staff get `not_authorized`.
- **The leader reference** (everyone but Khmer students and teams, `refNeeded_`) — it is a *leader*
  (pastor or leader) reference, never a friend's; the DTS form's contact section says so too: the applicant
  (dashboard, `refCardHtml_`) or staff (record panel, `panelReferenceHtml_`) makes a link with
  `portalReferenceLink` → `portal.html?ref=<token>`. The token is random, stored only as a
  sha256 hash in `cand.portal.references[]` (`refHash_`), expires after `REF_TTL_DAYS`
  (14), is single-use, and a new link revokes the pending one. Two public handlers need no
  account: `portalReferenceForm(token)` answers with the applicant's name, what they apply
  for and `forms.reference`; `portalReferenceSubmit(token, answers)` checks required, marks
  the token used, sets `portal.referenceDone` (ticks the timeline item) and logs "Leader
  reference received from …". `refState_` is what both sides see — the applicant's copy
  (`portalAppOut_`) never carries the leader's answers; staff read them under "Read it".
  The reference form is `referenceForm` in portal-forms-default.js (the base's Leader
  Reference Google Form; English only, Khmer left empty), key `reference`, editable in the
  Forms editor like the others. The leader's page is the `ref` view (`refHtml_`, gate look).
- **A team's trip is one 'stays' answer** (form type `stays`, question `itinerary` in the team form):
  `[{place, from, to}, …]`, the first row always our base (`base:true`, place = the campus name).
  Server: `cleanStays_` (drops empty extra rows, swaps reversed dates, cuts places at 80),
  `staysDone_` for required (base both dates, every added row complete). Page:
  `staysInputHtml_` + `calendarHtml_` (tap arrival then departure; two months from 600px),
  state in `P.cal`, writes go to the store for the input's prefix (`ansStore_`: a_ applicant,
  s_ staff edit, r_ reference) after `flushAnswers_`. `tripOf_` gives days in Cambodia (first
  arrival to last departure, inclusive), each place's days, and the first stop (visa); it also
  reads old applications' arrival / departure / arrivalKh / departureKh answers.
- **Team documents** (`PORTAL_DOC_KINDS.team`: passports, a team photo with names and flights
  first; then the letter of invitation and supporting documents `from: 'us'` — staff upload
  them, the team opens them and cannot upload or remove one — and the team's e-visas):
  `portalUploadDoc` (applicant after submitting, or staff in scope with a candidateId; PDF /
  images, ~4 MB, blobs `pdoc:<id>`, the record keeps only the list), `portalGetDoc`,
  `portalDeleteDoc` (own record, or portal staff / HR in scope). Required kinds all present tick
  the Documents item. The page shrinks big photos before upload (`shrinkImage_`).
- **A question can open an upload box** (`attach: '<doc kind>'` on a yesno / choice question,
  kept by `cleanForm_`): answered with its first option (Yes) the form shows `attachHtml_` —
  that document's upload list — under it, applicant side only. The team form's
  `flightsBooked` ("Have you booked your flights yet?") attaches `flights`, and
  `portalUploadDoc` lets a kind the form attaches go up before the application is submitted.
- **Staff record for a team**: `panelTripHtml_` (total in Cambodia, each place, who handles the
  visa) and `hospitalityHtml_` — a copy-ready note: team name, Siem Reap dates with days and
  nights, males, females, couples / families. The list row shows "N days in Cambodia".
- **Staff tools live in a bar, not the header** (`staffNavHtml_`, `#staffNav`: Applications `#navCrm`,
  Forms `#toForms` and Accounts `#toAccounts` for portal admins, View as applicant `#toPreview`).
  The header keeps only language and Sign out: on a phone, four more buttons in it overflowed
  over the title and pushed Sign out off screen. The bar wraps rather than scrolls.
  The bar ends with **🔗 Link for applicants** (`#toLink`, `P.linkOpen`, `applyLinkHtml_`). It
  opens a panel holding the portal link to copy (`#applyLinkBox`, `#copyApplyLink`) and a chip
  for each kind of application (`[data-linkkind]`). Picking a kind copies `portal.html?apply=<key>`,
  which opens sign-up straight on that application. A scoped staff member only gets the kinds
  they work.
- **View as applicant** (staff side, anyone with portal access; `previewHtml_`, view `preview`,
  staff-bar button, and "View as this applicant" on the record panel): `portalViewAs(username, pin,
  {candidateId})` returns one record's own boot (scope applies, no PIN material) and
  `portalViewAs(…, {type, school, audience, stage, campus})` a sample applicant built through
  the same `portalAppOut_` / `getForms_`; nothing is written. The page swaps `P.boot` /
  `P.answers` for the preview boot, draws `meHtml_` or `formHtml_` (section chips), restores,
  and puts the result in `#pvFrame` with `inert` + pointer-events none, so nothing inside binds
  or fires.
- **Sign-up answers like portalBoot, form included** (`portalRegister`), and **lands straight in
  the application** (`openForm_`) — people made the account and forgot to apply. Until it is
  submitted the dashboard's hero says "Next: send in your application" (`#applyNext`,
  `#openFormTop`). `openForm_` still copes with a reply that lacks the form (refetches
  `portalBoot`; `bindForm_` returns without a form) — the first live team sign-up hit exactly
  that and got the error screen.
- **A team names its sending church, base or organization at sign-up** (`#r_team` →
  `teamName`, required on the page, optional for staff-made accounts): `createApplicant_` puts
  it in the draft as `teamName`, so the staff list (`candName_`) shows the team, not the
  leader, from day one and the form opens with its first question filled in.
- **Steps for anyone asked for a reference** (students not from Cambodia, staff, volunteers):
  Create account → Fill out the application → **Send your leader reference** → "Application &
  reference received" (done only when both are in) → We get in touch → Documents → … The
  reference is its own step, no longer a sub-item of Documents, and its own card on the
  dashboard (`#refCard`, right under the application). Moving the record to contacted counts
  the reference as in. Without a reference (Khmer students) the step is left out.
- **A dead screen is the worst failure**: `render()` wraps building and binding in try/catch
  and shows the error with a Back button instead of leaving nothing clickable.
- **Khmer or international** (`audienceOf_` — country Cambodia at sign-up, which is why
  country is required there): `refNeeded_` is false for Khmer students and for teams (no
  reference step then); `needsVisa_` is true for everyone not from
  Cambodia, and their dashboard shows the e-visa guide (`visaCardHtml_`, the text in
  `VISA_STEPS` / `VISA_PREP`) from acceptance on, with two ticks staff set on the record
  (`portalSetVisaFlags`: flightsConfirmed, invitationSent). A team's Documents card lists
  `TEAM_NEEDS`.
- **Deleting an applicant** (`portalDeleteApplicant`, portal admins / app admins only): removes
  the CRM record, any document blobs it lists, and the applicant account behind it — never a
  staff account (a record whose `staffId` is real staff loses only the record). The panel's
  "Delete this account and application" asks for the name to be typed back. Applicant
  accounts are not in Admin → Accounts, so this is their one delete.
- **A team has its own stages and journey.**
  - **Stages** (`TEAM_STAGES`): new → applied → call1 (1st call) → docs (awaiting documents)
    → call2 (2nd call, cultural orientation) → practical → arrived. There is no interview.
    Older team stages map across on read (`TEAM_STAGE_FROM`: contacted or interview → call1,
    accepted → docs), and `cleanCandidate_` takes a team's own stages.
  - **Steps** (`teamSteps_`, used by `portalAppOut_` and `portalCandOut_`), in order:
    account, form, **call1**, then the documents group (**passports**, **photo**, **flights**),
    then the visa group (**invitation**: the letter of invitation and supporting documents,
    uploaded by staff; **evisa**: approved e-visas, uploaded by the team), then **call2**,
    **practical** and **arrived**. The visa group appears only for a team that needs a visa.
  - Each step carries `who` ('you' or 'us') and either `auto` (it ticks itself when its
    document is on the record) or `tick` (a staff checkbox through
    `portalTeamStep(user, pin, candId, step, done)`, for call1 / call2 / arrived).
  - **The stage follows the steps forward on its own** (`teamAutoStage_`, run after a tick
    and after every upload): call1 done → docs; passports + photo + flights in and the
    e-visas approved → call2; call2 done → practical. It never moves back; unticking Arrived
    returns the team to practical. Every move is logged.
  - On the team's side, the visa card and the letter and e-visa uploads stay hidden until
    passports, photo and flights are in. Portal staff get `teamStages` for the stage picker
    and for the Teams tab's chips and tiles. The GP app's HR page uses `TEAM_CAND_STAGES`
    for a team.
- **A team application is a team in the Teams Database** (`syncTeamTrip_`, linked by
  `candidateId`, id `ta_<candId>`).
  - It is made on submit and updated on every answer change, whether the team makes it
    (`portalUpdateAnswers`) or staff do (`portalStaffSaveAnswers`). Closing the application
    cancels the team and reopening it restores it.
  - The name, where the team is from, the Siem Reap dates and the head counts follow the
    application. Metrics, men and women reached, notes and hosting staff are kept.
  - The team enters its own Outreach Teams numbers on its dashboard (`#teamNumbers`,
    `portalSaveTeamNumbers`; shown — and accepted, else `not_arrived` — only once staff have
    ticked Arrived, so it doesn’t confuse a team before it comes). The
    metric list comes from `taxonomy.js` plus `metricOverrides` in the applicant's
    `portalBoot`.
  - Staff still edit everything in the Teams Database; `saveTeamTrip` keeps the link, and
    the card shows "🛂 From the portal". A team deleted there stays deleted: the tombstone
    keeps its `candidateId`.
  - **Every team application is in, at any stage** — submitted or not, dates or not, even one
    added in the CRM (`hrSaveCandidate` syncs it). `cleanTrip_` lets a linked team (`candidateId`)
    have no dates yet; it is listed with "Dates not set yet", not on the calendar, and `tripFromApp_`
    keeps what staff filled in when the application has nothing for a field.
  - **Pending until its flights are confirmed** (`teamFlightsIn_`: flight itinerary uploaded,
    `visa.flightsConfirmed`, or the team past the documents stage): a linked team still waiting
    comes back from `getTeamTrips` with `pending: true` and its `portalStage`, and
    `withTeamRows_` leaves it out of the dashboards (`pendingTeamIds_`). The Teams Database
    shows "⏳ Pending", keeps it under "Here now or coming" even once its dates
    have passed, and its own tiles skip it (`tripFinished_`).
  - **The team card is short** (`teamCardHtml_`): name, "⏳ Pending", the dates and number of
    days, and people (total, men, women); a finished team says whether its numbers are in. The
    rest is in Edit. **🛂 Open application** (`[data-openapp]`, for anyone with portal access)
    links to `portal.html?open=<candidateId>`, which opens that record on the staff side of the
    portal (`openFromLink_`) and tidies the address.
  - **Volunteers Mobilized is the team's head count** for a team leaving on or after
    `TEAM_AUTO_FROM` (2026-10-01). `tripMetrics_` in api.js gives the dashboards `size` in its
    place, and `tripMetric_` in teams.html does the same for the Teams Database tiles. Neither the
    Teams Database form (`teamInputMetrics_`) nor the portal's numbers boxes have an input for it.
    Earlier teams keep the number logged for them. YWAM Nelson is in `team-seed.js` (Alexis's
    week-37 entries, 17 people), so it keeps its 29.
  - **Recovered numbers** (`recover` on a `team-seed.js` row): YWAM Dalat (week-31 entries) and
    Church on the Rock (week-32 entries) carry the Outreach Teams figures logged by hand for the
    week each left. `getTeamTrips_` gives them to a saved team that is the same team (same campus,
    name has the `recover` word, left within 7 days) when it has no numbers yet, and drops the
    seed row; otherwise the seed row is the team. Either way it counts once.
  - **Calendar** (`teamCalHtml_`, `S.teamView='cal'`, `S.teamCalYm`, `S.teamCalSel`) is a
    month grid with weeks starting on Monday. Each team is a bar across its days, split at
    the week edge (`.cont` / `.more`) and laned when teams overlap. Bars are coloured pending,
    coming, here or been, and tapping one opens its card. The month's teams are listed underneath.
  - **Numbers from the portal, both sides**: the team's dashboard card shows as soon as it
    has applied (a missing link is made on its `portalBoot`), and the staff record has the
    same boxes (`portalStaffSaveTeamNumbers`, `teamTrip` on each team in the staff boot).
  - **Drafts count too.** A team goes in as soon as its application has Siem Reap dates,
    whether submitted or still a draft. `portalSaveDraft` syncs it, and nothing is written
    when nothing changed. On the staff record, `#teamDbState` says whether the team is in the
    Teams Database. If it isn't, **Add to the Teams Database** (`portalStaffSyncTeam`) puts it in,
    or explains why it can't: `no_dates` or `deleted`.
  - Applications from before the link existed, or whose sync was missed, are filled in
    by `backfillTeamTrips_` every time the Teams Database is read (`getTeamTrips`, and so
    `getMyBoot` for Outreach Teams staff). It covers submitted, open team applications with
    no linked row at all, so a deleted team is never brought back. An application from before
    the trip question takes its earliest and latest date answers.
- **The timeline is derived on the server** (`portalAppOut_` → `portalSteps_` /
  `portalStatus_`): account → form → received → contact → documents & reference →
  interview → accepted → practical → arrived, walked from the CRM stage in
  `PORTAL_STAGE_ORDER`; status ∈ draft | pending | in_review | interview | accepted |
  practical | arrived | closed. The applicant never sees the owner or the next step.
  `CAND_STAGES` gained `practical` (fees, packing, visa, travel) and `CAND_TYPES` gained
  `team` — both sides.
- **portal.html has its own look, on purpose — it is NOT in the YWAM GP theme.** Black page,
  white type, Inter + Kantumruy Pro, one centred card at a time (the way an application
  portal reads: logo and "YWAM GP Portal" on top, then sign in, with "Start an
  application" leading to the seven choices). Its `:root` tokens live in the page;
  `test-theme.mjs` keeps checking only index / teams / help. `body.gate` is every screen
  before sign-in (centred hero header); signed in, the header is a slim bar. `PORTAL_LOGO`
  at the top of the script names the YWAM mark file once it is dropped into `public/`;
  until then the GP mark stands in and no missing file is requested. Fonts out of the
  render path, `logo.js` + `km.js` + `taxonomy.js`, session under `gp-portal` (not
  `gp-staff`), one `portalBoot` per open. Deep links
  `?apply=dts|dbs|bcs|sms|staff|volunteer|team`, `?lang=km|en`, `?ref=` (milestone 3).
  Responsive for real: one column on a phone, `.two` two columns and the CRM list + side
  panel from 900px. All strings through `t()`; `test-khmer.mjs` scans portal.html too.
- Tests: `test-portal.mjs` (server: sign-up rules, every closed door, own record only,
  the access matrix, timeline follows the stage), `test-portal-page.mjs` (browser: front
  door + deep link, sign-up, dashboard, Khmer, desktop layout, staff side),
  `test-admin-portal-access.mjs` (the Admin screen).

## Personality types (public/personality.js)

Anyone can take a 40-statement questionnaire (or pick a type they already know)
and get one of the sixteen four-letter types, a drawn character for it (male or
female), a description, and tips that change with their ministry and the season
they say they are in. Entry: the Personality card on My Home; a teammate's type
from their profile. Screens: `ptestHtml` (S.view 'ptest') and `ptypeHtml` ('ptype').

- **Everything in personality.js is YWAM GP's own** — the questions, type names ("The
  Guide", "The Host"…), descriptions, tips and the avatar art. Only the four
  letters and the idea of four preference pairs come from Jung / Myers–Briggs.
  "Myers-Briggs" and "MBTI" are trademarks and the official questionnaire is
  copyrighted; 16Personalities' test, type names, text and characters are theirs.
  Never paste any of it in, however close a match looks. The screens may look
  16Personalities-like; the words and pictures must stay ours. The fine print on
  every screen says it is not the official MBTI® assessment — keep it.
- **Who sees what** (tests/test-personality.mjs holds all of it):
  - the no-PIN `teamRoster` is public to the internet and carries **none** of it —
    `publicStaff_` is unchanged; `rosterStaff_` adds the avatar for signed-in
    callers only (boot roster, `teamRoster(user, pin)`, `staffProfile`);
  - a teammate sees a type, its avatar (type + sex) and its bars only while its
    owner has "Show my type to the team" on (the default);
  - **season is private** — "a stretched season" says how someone is doing, which
    is not a directory fact. It lives only in the owner's `profile.personality`.
- **Team → Personalities** (`teamPersonalityHtml_`, `S.teamMode='pers'`): the team's mix
  added up on the page from the roster's shared `avatar.type` — so someone with sharing
  off is neither counted nor named, and season never appears. Whole campus by default;
  a department or one ministry from the select (`S.teamPScope`). The four groups, each
  pair with the team's lean (`TP_LEAN` 65% or more on one side; `TP_LEAN_TEXT` is YWAM GP's
  own wording) and who has which type. Counts only, never anyone's bars.
- **The server re-checks the maths.** `cleanPScores_` refuses bars that disagree
  with the letters (E:80 on an I type), so the screen can never contradict itself.
- **The type and season lists exist twice** (personality.js and `PTYPE_CODES` /
  `PSEASON_IDS` in api.js); the test fails if they drift.
- **Scoring is balanced on purpose:** five statements keyed each way per pair, so
  agreeing with everything lands on 50/50 rather than on a type.
- **Khmer:** all ~390 strings are in `PENDING_KM` (machine-translated, unreviewed —
  docs/khmer-needed.md §52, questions first). Type names translate as one phrase
  via `pTheName()` — Khmer has no article, so never glue a translated "The" on.

## GP Strengths (public/gpstrengths.js) — the free strengths finder, YWAM GP's own

Thirty-four strengths in four groups — Doing (9), Leading (8), Relating (9),
Thinking (8) — found through 102 "which is more like you?" pairs (~15 min,
saved as you go). Results: a Top 5 with what each means, what to watch for and
how the team can use it; for the owner, where their top 10 fall across the four
groups and all 34 ranked. The Team tab's Strengths map adds up everyone's Top 5.
(A CliftonStrengths recorder existed briefly; it was removed. Any Gallup
results saved then are still in `staff.strengths` but nothing reads them.)

- **YWAM GP's own, through and through — Uriah's call.** The app has no
  CliftonStrengths feature and never mentions Gallup or CliftonStrengths on
  screen. Every name, statement and description is YWAM GP's own; never borrow a
  Gallup theme name or a variant of one (the test checks five-letter stems
  both ways against Gallup's 34, kept in the test only), their wording or
  their domain names.
- **Pairs, not agree/disagree**, so it ranks rather than rating every good thing
  highly. The pairs are fair by construction and the test re-checks it: each
  strength in six pairs, three each side, always against another group and
  against every other group at least once, never the same pair twice, never in
  consecutive pairs, each of its six statements used once.
- **The server scores it.** The page sends only `answers`; `gpStrengthsScore_`
  in api.js works out scores (−12…+12) and the Top 5 (tie-break: score, then
  strong choices won, then list order — same as `gpGSScore`). A `top` sent by
  the page is ignored. `GS_IDS` / `GS_PAIRS` mirror gpstrengths.js; the test
  fails on drift.
- **Visibility:** nothing on the public roster; `rosterStaff_` and
  `staffProfile` carry the Top 5 ids while shared — never the answers or scores;
  the owner's `profile.gstrengths` has everything. Draft answers live in
  localStorage (`gp_gstr_draft`) until saved.
- **Khmer:** all ~515 strings in `PENDING_KM` (docs/khmer-needed.md §53).

## Library (public/library.js) — ten-minute reads
Menu → Library. All 44 books from Craig Groeschel's four leadership lists ("44 Books
Every Leader Should Read", the current list Uriah sent — Lead Like Jesus, not Dalio's
Principles), on four shelves (Lead & grow, People & culture, Habits & goals, Create &
communicate). `GP_LIBRARY.startHere` is the "⭐ Start here" chip: ten to read first for
leading at YWAM GP (culture, teams, hard conversations, vision, systems, execution).
- **Our own words.** Each summary (vibe, big idea, 8–10 key ideas, try this week, "for us
  at YWAM GP", one line) is written for YWAM GP — no quotations, nothing from the books or any
  summary service. Brain and money claims are framed as the author's view where debated.
  About 2,000–2,500 words each (Oct 2026: lengthened towards Blinkist, `mins` 10) — each
  key idea 180–240 words with a story or example from the book (ours are labelled
  "Simple everyday example").
- **Audio is OFF in the app for now** (Oct 2026, Uriah: the phone voices — iPhone's above
  all — aren't good enough). `LIB_AUDIO_ON=false` in teams.html hides every 🎧 and fetches
  nothing; the player below stays, tested, for when the books are recorded.
- **Recording is by hand, not in the app:** `scripts/record-library-audio.mjs` (Andrew will
  set up the Azure account; Microsoft Azure Speech is the one service with natural Khmer —
  Sreymom, Piseth — as well as English). `--lang en|km --voice andrew|ava|…|sreymom|piseth`,
  `--dry-run` (characters, rough cost: ~$10 a language), `--books a,b`, `--force`; files to
  ./library-audio (gitignored), or `--upload` (NETLIFY_SITE_ID + NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN) straight
  into the blob store `gp-audio` — NOT `gp-data`, so the nightly backup doesn't copy it. One
  MP3 per reader screen, saying exactly what that screen shows; a second run records only
  screens whose text or voice changed. AZURE_SPEECH_KEY / AZURE_SPEECH_REGION live only in
  the runner's environment. `audio.js` (files, read-only, public) and api `libAudioIndex`
  (which books are recorded) serve it; turn `LIB_AUDIO_ON` on and the reader plays a book's
  recording (fetched whole for iPhones, next screen fetched ahead, page turned on its end,
  Media Session lock-screen controls), the phone's voice only where there is none.
- **The player** (🎧, built Oct 2026, off — see above): `libAudio*` in teams.html; without a recording it uses the phone's own voice
  (speechSynthesis — free, offline, nothing stored). 🎧 Listen on a book page, or 🎧 in the
  reader's top bar, reads the open screen in order (the paragraph lit, `.libSpeaking`),
  turns the page at the end of each step and stops at the final summary; ⏸ stops; the
  speed (0.8–1.5×) is kept as `gp-lib-rate`; leaving the reader stops it. Khmer needs a
  Khmer voice on the phone (many Androids can add one; iPhones have none) — without it the
  app says so rather than reading Khmer in an English voice. tests/test-library-audio-ui.mjs.
- **Made at YWAM GP** (shelf `gp`, shown first after Start here): original guides written for
  YWAM GP — `original: true`, author "GP Library", no ISBN — so far Working Well with
  Westerners (for Khmer staff) and Working Well with Cambodians (for Western staff), 11 key
  ideas and ~3,000 words each (`mins` 14) — and **FIGHT: Our Values** (`fight-our-values`,
  Oct 2026), a guide to YWAM GP's five values built on leadership's statements and behaviours
  (cover motif `fight`; `overview: 'fight'` puts the 1-on-1 check-in's FIGHT overview —
  `fightOverviewHtml_`, built from `OO_FLOW` / `OO_VALUES` — on its first reader page, `#fightOv`) — the first two mirroring each other on money, conflict, the
  body and men and women, and learning each other's language. Their
  fine print says they are not published books and describe tendencies, not rules. The
  shelf's colour is YWAM GP ink (#17150F), not laterite — the brown clashed with the black YWAM GP.
- **Keeping Each Other Safe** (`keeping-each-other-safe`, Made at YWAM GP, Oct 2026): the
  safeguarding guide — what safeguarding is, kinds of concern, how to raise one in the app
  (Team → Advisory Board → Raise a concern, which emails only the safeguarding contacts),
  emergency numbers in Cambodia (Police 117, Ambulance 119, Fire 118, Child Helpline 1280),
  what to do when someone tells you, and everyday safe habits. It invents no YWAM GP policy:
  it says the written policy comes from the leaders and the board. The concern card links
  to it (`data-safeguide`).
- **YWAM classics** (shelf `ywam`, 🌊, cobalt; shown right after Made at YWAM GP; Oct 2026):
  ten foundational YWAM books in the same ten-minute shape, in English and Khmer — Is That
  Really You, God?, Making Jesus Lord, Daring to Live on the Edge (Loren Cunningham),
  Intimate Friendship with God and Intercession, Thrilling and Fulfilling (Joy Dawson),
  The Father Heart of God (Floyd McClung), Spiritual Warfare for Every Christian (Dean
  Sherman), Discipling Nations (Darrow Miller), The Book That Transforms Nations and Why
  Not Women? (Cunningham). No ISBNs (not guessed). Written by Claude from what is known
  of each book, without the books to hand — details it was unsure of were left out;
  someone who has read them should check. Covers use motifs waves, crown, edge, flame,
  incense, heart, shield, globe, openbook, pair. The test expects 44 + the GP guides + 10.
- **Khmer** (`public/library-km.js`, `GP_LIBRARY_KM`, keyed by book id, same parts in the
  same order) is loaded only when someone reads in Khmer (`libLoadKm_`), and is NOT in the
  service worker's install list (~1.8 MB raw) — it is kept offline after that first read. The
  Library **follows the app's language, with no switch of its own** (`libLang_`; the old
  `gp-lib-lang` is ignored): in Khmer every cover, tile, title and author is Khmer too —
  every entry has a `title` and `author` (`libTitle_`, `libAuthor_`; authors sounded out in
  Khmer letters), and covers draw Khmer titles in Kantumruy Pro, sized by length.
  `libKmEnsure_` loads the file and says so if it can't. Written by Claude in plain spoken
  Khmer; "ministry" is កិច្ចការបម្រើ as in km.js. Titles and authors are in khmer-needed.md for review.
  When a summary changes in library.js, change its Khmer too — the test checks the shape.
- **Loaded only when opened** (`libLoad_`, `data-optional` so a failed load says so on
  the page instead of the whole-app error screen); sw.js precaches it for offline reading.
- **Covers nod to the real books, drawn by us** (Oct 2026): each book's `cover` in
  library.js (built from covers.json) picks colours from `GP_LIBRARY.palette` (the app's
  paper, ink, cobalt, marigold and the shelf hues), a type style (sans / serif / display),
  title top or bottom, and a motif from `LIB_MOTIFS` in teams.html — the one idea its real
  cover is known for (Start with Why's circle, Made to Stick's tape, the Tipping Point's
  match, Purple Cow's cow), as our own simple SVG, never the publisher's art. Titles are
  sized so the longest word never breaks, then `libFitTitles_` shrinks any that still
  overflow in the font the phone actually has. Moving parts (`cv*` classes) animate only
  while on screen (`libLiveCovers_`, IntersectionObserver) and never under reduced
  motion. A book without a `cover` falls back to the shelf's patterned series cover.
  Nothing is fetched; covers work offline.
- **Laid out like a book-summary app:** the home is rows you swipe sideways (Continue
  reading, Start here, one per shelf, each with See all → a two-column grid), tiles with
  the cover on a tinted square; a book page with Start reading, What's it about, What's
  inside; a reader (`libReaderHtml_`, `S.libStep`) one key idea per screen — intro, the
  ideas, a final summary — with a progress bar. **Pages turn by swiping** (a slide-in
  animation, `S.libDir`); there are no Back/Next buttons along the bottom — only slim ‹ ›
  tabs at the screen edges (`#libPrev` / `#libNext`) and, on the last screen, Done — mark
  as read. The first three times a book is opened a "Swipe to turn the page" pill with a
  moving 👆 shows (`S.libHint`, `gp-lib-swipehint`; a swipe retires it). The reader is a
  full-screen fixed layer on the plain page colour; while it is open the body has class
  `libReading` (NOT `reading` — that is the Bible verse banner's class, and sharing it
  painted the reader yellow-brown). Tiles, the book page and the reader take the tint of
  the book's own cover (`libTint_`). Library headings use the body font; Koulen is for the
  covers only.
- "Read" ticks (`gp-lib-read`) and where you are in a book (`gp-lib-progress`) are this
  phone's only (localStorage). To add a book, add an object to `GP_LIBRARY.books`;
  tests/test-library.mjs checks the shape.

## Looking around without an account (teams.html guest mode, Oct 2026)
"Look around without an account" on the log-in screen, or `teams.html?guest=1`, sets
`gp-app-guest` (localStorage — they stay a guest on reopen until Log in / Create my
profile). `S.guest` with a stand-in `S.me` (`gpGuestMe_`, id 'guest') and EMPTY `S.auth`:
- **Open:** My Home becomes a tour (`gpGuestHomeHtml_`: every tool, what it does, 🔒),
  the whole **Library** (ticks on the phone; `libAdoptServer_` sends them up once they
  log in), and **Base** from the public `getData('')` with the staff counted from the
  public `teamRoster` — names and photos dropped on arrival — plus a campus switch.
- **Locked with a reason:** Team (names, photos, goals) and Health (private check-ins);
  the menu is Library / Create my profile / Log in. Any other view falls back to the tour.
- No call a guest makes carries a username or PIN, and the boot never runs (test-guest-ui).
  **Guests never see the old dashboard (Oct 2026):** index.html's "View as guest" goes to
  `teams.html?guest=1`, and its `<head>` guard sends any guest (`gp-app-guest` in
  localStorage, or the old `gp-guest` in sessionStorage) there too, unless
  `gp-skip-teams` is set — the one way to open that page on purpose (tests do). Base's
  "See the full dashboard" link is hidden for guests.

## Required papers and the books-read tally (Oct 2026)
- **Books read** are on the staff record (`libRead: {bookId: date}`, `libSaveReads`), with the
  phone's copy and a queue of unsent changes (`gp-lib-pending`) so it works offline. Only the
  COUNT leaves through staffProfile (`booksRead`); the count shows on Team → person, My
  profile and the About me tile, and each opens the Library. Logout clears the phone's copy.
- **Required papers** (HR → ✍️ Required, admins and HR): the list is `reqDocs` (title, a PDF
  as `reqfile:<id>` or a link, a version). Staff read → tick → type their name → draw a
  signature (`reqSign`); the record keeps `signed: {docId: {v, at, name}}` and the drawn PNG
  is `reqsig:<docId>:<staffId>`. A replaced file with "ask everyone to sign again" bumps the
  version. The **staff contract** half is HR's own record: done while the newest contract
  hasn't run out. `requiredFor_` is the one place a status is worked out.
- Who sees what: the person sees their own (My Home card until finished, My profile);
  admins and HR see "Profile unfinished" on anyone's profile, the everyone list, and
  signatures. Teammates see nothing of it — the contract half is HR's business.

## My Ministry tools: the numbers as a by-product (Oct 2026)
The direction: each My Ministry page becomes a tool that serves the ministry, and its weekly
numbers fill themselves in from using it (like Teams and Hospitality). Two so far:
- **Campus Leadership → "My week"** (`lwHtml_`/`bindLw_`; api `leadWeek`, `leadLogAdd`,
  `leadLogDelete`, `leadReflectSave`, `leadPartnerSave/Delete`, `basePlantSave`). Anyone in
  Campus Leadership with a ministry; the leadership board is the second tab. A quick log
  (`LW_KINDS` → `LEAD_KINDS` metrics: one-on-ones with who, partner connections, church/base
  talks, gospel hours, teaching, meetings), partners with "Connected", base plants with a
  stage (not launched → Base Plants in Planning, Director or admin), and the Director's 1–10
  reflection (`LEAD_RATINGS`). Blobs `leadLog`, `leadReflect`, `leadPartners`, `basePlants`.
- **Community Service → Cafe** (`cafeHtml_`/`bindCafe_`; api `cafe*`). Today (opening
  checklist → "We're open", closing checklist + cash), Till (menu → order → Charge; prices
  come from the SERVER's menu, never the phone; gospel/salvation counters; expenses; undo),
  Rota (the team fills shifts), Week (tiles, cups a day, best sellers), Set up (the cafe's
  leader or an admin: menu, checklists, shifts). `cafe:<campus>` holds settings, each day
  is `cafeDay:<campus>:<date>`. "The numbers" tab is the old page.
- **Campus Leadership tabs — each role its own board** (Oct 2026, Uriah: "for all the campus
  leadership, each person should have a slightly different My Ministry board. Not everyone
  has the same thing"). `LW_ROLES` in teams/04-ministry-strengths.js, keyed by the title
  (`lwRole_` from `orgTitleOf_`): the tab order, a line under "Your role", the four glance
  tiles at the top of Overview, and which kinds come first under "Log something".
  International Campus Director — "Vision, partners and new bases": Overview · My week ·
  Board · Finances; partners to reach (none in 30 days), Base Plants in Planning, money
  ahead, clear leaders; partner/church/base first. National Campus Director — "The staff
  and the week's rhythm": Overview · Board · My week · Finances; away this week, 1-on-1s
  this month (both summed from the departments' pulse), numbers in, Tuesday; 1-on-1s and
  meetings first. Director of a department — "Your department …": My department · Board ·
  My week · Finances; their pulse first, no whole-base tiles; department meetings first.
  An untitled Campus Director keeps the old four (clear leaders, numbers in, Tuesday, money
  ahead). **Every role opens on its first tab** each time the app is opened; a tab chosen
  stays for that visit only (`gp-lw-tab` in sessionStorage — tests set it there). The
  leadership-team card sits at the foot of Overview, under the role's own numbers.
  tests/test-lead-roles-ui.mjs. The Cafe's tool/numbers choice is `gp-cafe-view`.
- **Opening another leadership role's board** (Oct 2026, Uriah: "I want to be able to click
  different ministry from the campus leadership department then what leadership ministry
  from there"). Under Campus Leadership the ministry picker lists each leadership role —
  International and National Campus Director (keys `@icd` / `@ncd`, since both are the
  "Campus Director" row), then a Director for each department (its name) — for Campus
  Directors and admins (`canBrowseBl_`; the pulse behind a board is theirs to see,
  `canSeePulse_`). Your own role is marked "· you" (`blMyKey_`). Another role opens as they
  see it (`blViewOf_` → `S.lwView`, read by `leadBaseHtml_`): "Viewing: <title> · <who holds
  it>", that role's line, tabs and tiles — but never their "My week" (it's theirs), and the
  partners tile becomes "Numbers in" (partners are each director's own). The lazy
  `getMinistryFor` load skips Campus Leadership.
  **Overview** (`leadBaseHtml_`): for the
  Director (or an admin) four glance tiles, then clear leaders (from each person's `leads`,
  `ministryLeaders_`), next Tuesday, the money ahead (a tile that opens Finances), and every department's pulse folded;
  a department overseer gets their pulse first, then their ministries' leaders. The bell's
  "See them" opens Overview. **Board** keeps the Director's quarter, OKRs, the Monday
  board, notes, and the **Tuesday** tab (`leadTuesHtml_`, api `saveLeadTuesday`): the next
  eight Tuesdays, each with facilitator, translator (a person on the campus by id, or a
  typed guest name) and topics — stored as `tues` on the leadership board doc.
- **The money ahead** (`finAheadHtml_` on the Finances tab; api `finAheadSave`, blob
  `finProj:<campus>`): a six-month projection of money coming in and going out from the cash
  in the bank the Finances office enters with the P&L, with the month it runs short; the
  boxes show the last three months' P&L average as a placeholder. Oct 2026: no longer behind
  the leadership code — Campus Leadership's, signed in (`finCanView_`). `finProjGet` /
  `finProjSave` (the code, failing closed) still answer for anything old, on the same blob.
- **HangPopok** (the cafe's real POS, a Cambodian cloud POS; no public API found): the leader
  picks "Our till" in Set up (`settings.till`). In HangPopok mode the Till tab asks for the
  day's sales, receipts and cups at closing (`cafePos` → `day.pos`), counted like in-app sales.
  An automatic link waits on HangPopok offering an export or API.
- **`toolSync_`** writes a week's totals into `entries` with `by: 'tool:lead'`/`'tool:cafe'`
  (current year). A week with nothing logged clears ONLY rows the tool wrote — a number
  someone typed by hand is never overwritten by an empty tool week.
- Next (planned, not built): Community Schools / YDC — enrolment, attendance on each
  student's profile, test scores, progress, who has paid → Students Enrolled, Days with
  Classes, Passing Rate, etc.

## Admin → Arrivals & departures
- **Invite a new group:** pick campus, department and (optionally) ministry → one link,
  `teams.html?reg=1&campus=…&dept=…&ministry=…` (`gpInviteLink_`). It opens the
  sign-up form with those chosen and a "You're joining …" line (`gpInviteFromUrl_`,
  `S.regPrefill`). **It grants nothing**: everyone still picks their own username, PIN
  and email, and a Campus Leadership sign-up still waits for an admin. Values that
  aren't a real campus / department / ministry are dropped. Admins do not create
  accounts or choose anyone's PIN — deliberately not built.
- **Archive several people:** search (name, ministry, role), Select all shown, a
  confirm step, date and reason → `hrArchiveMany` (admin or HR, never yourself, up to
  200): the same `archived` record as HR's single archive, all in **one** write of the
  staff list so a group can't race itself; someone already archived is left as they
  were. Bringing back is still one at a time (`hrUnarchive`).

## Admin → Loose ends
One page of the small gaps that quietly make the base's totals wrong, one campus at
a time (`adminLooseHtml_`), each row a tap away from the person (Admin → person) or
the ministry (My Ministry): ministries with nobody set to enter numbers or someone
no longer active; no numbers for three weeks or more; not opened the app in 30 days;
no department or ministry; no mentor; this quarter's objectives nobody has edited in
30 days (not ones a ministry's numbers feed — `metricKey` — which move by
themselves). Long lists show five and fold the rest.
- **The page builds it** from `adminLooseEnds` (admin only: last week with numbers per
  ministry this year, numbers people, last-seen dates, this quarter's objectives) and
  taxonomy.js's structure, which the server has no copy of.
- **Last seen is the date only** (`lastSeen` blob: `{started, seen:{id:date}}`),
  written by `markSeen` — the page calls it at most once a day per phone after a good
  boot. **The boot itself still writes nothing** (test-boot.mjs). "Not opened in 30
  days" lists nobody until 30 days after `started`; it says when it fills in.

## Opening with no connection (public/sw.js and the boot copy)
- **Pull to refresh also brings in a new version** (Oct 2026, Uriah). Data refreshed but
  the page didn't — an iPhone home-screen app can stay in memory for days on old code.
  The page notes its version at start (`gpVerBase`: ETags of teams.html, km.js and
  library.js by `HEAD …?ver=`, which the worker never touches); `gpPullRefresh_` checks
  again (3.5s cap) and, if anything changed, `gpReloadForUpdate_` reloads with `?fresh=`
  — sw.js then waits up to 15s for the network instead of 4 — back to the same tab
  (`gp-resume` in sessionStorage, `gpResumeView_`), and the address is cleaned. When the
  worker serves a page from its kept copy it leaves `served-from-cache` in the
  `gp-meta` cache; that page's first pull that reaches the server reloads. No ETag or no
  network → no reload, the data still refreshes. tests/test-pull-update-ui.mjs.
- **sw.js is network first, always.** A push to main is live at once, and a phone
  running yesterday's page against today's server is worse than a slow load. Pages
  and scripts come from the network; the kept copy is used only when the network
  fails or takes over 4 seconds (`NET_WAIT_MS`), and a late network answer still
  refreshes the copy. Only same-origin GETs: the API (a POST), `/.netlify/` and Google
  Fonts are never touched. Bump `SHELL` when `PRECACHE` changes — and add any new
  `<script src>` teams.html loads to `PRECACHE`.
- **The data is the page's last getMyBoot,** kept in localStorage as `gp-boot-cache`
  (`{user, at, d}`; skipped over 3 MB). With no connection — or a server that answers
  but not with a page — a remembered session boots from it (`gpBootFromCache_`) with
  `S.offlineSince` set, and every screen gets the "No connection — this is your page
  as it was on …" line. Back online (`online`, or the app coming back to the front) it
  boots again by itself. Another user's copy is never used; logging out or a refused
  PIN deletes it. It is what that phone was already showing, behind the PIN it
  already remembers.
- **Ministry numbers queue offline now,** beside goals and the health check-in
  (`gpSaveMinistry_`): the week's, month's and quarter's boxes and an overseer's card.
  Queue key `min:<dept>|<ministry>|<week>`; a second save to the same key **merges by
  metric** (newer box wins) instead of replacing. Shown at once (`gpMinistryOverlay_`)
  and re-applied over a fresh boot until sent. The daily count path (`saveMyKpiDay`)
  does not queue: its numbers add up, and replaying one twice would double it.
- **The copy draws first on every open,** not only offline. With a remembered session
  and a copy for that user, `boot()` applies it at once with `S.bootStale` (a thin
  "Updating…" bar) and the fresh boot replaces it (`gpBootFresh_`). While stale,
  **`run()` holds every call but `getMyBoot`** (`_gpHeld`) and sends them in order once
  the fresh boot lands — so nothing is saved against the copy — or, if the boot fails,
  releases them into the offline handling; a refused PIN drops them unsent.
- **Server side, each request reads each blob once** (`readJSON` keeps the store's raw
  text per request; each reader parses its own copy), and `getMyBoot` starts every read
  it needs at once (`prefetch_`, `BOOT_KEYS`). A boot went from 66 blob reads (staff ×19,
  loginThrottle ×24) to 18. Add a key a boot reads to `BOOT_KEYS`.
- **Not under a test browser** unless `localStorage['gp-sw-test']` is set
  (`navigator.webdriver`): a worker serving cached files would change what every other
  browser test tests. tests/test-offline-open-ui.mjs sets it.

## Nightly backup (netlify/functions/backup.js)
A scheduled function, `0 20 * * *` (03:00 Phnom Penh), copies every key in `gp-data`
into a second store, `gp-backups`, and keeps 30 nights. Before it there was no other
copy of anything.
- **Stored once, listed nightly.** `obj/<sha256>` holds a value's bytes the first
  time that exact content is seen; `day/YYYY-MM-DD` lists every key and its hash that
  night. Unchanged keys and uploaded documents cost nothing extra per night. Pruning
  drops lists past the newest 30, then every object no kept list points to.
- **Never trust `list({ prefix })`.** @netlify/blobs' own server answers a slashed
  prefix with nothing, and a backup that thinks it has no nights deletes every object
  it holds. `listAll_` lists the whole store and filters in code;
  tests/test-backup-real.mjs runs the real library to keep that true (the fake in
  test-backup.mjs answers a prefix with nothing too, on purpose).
- **The app reads only `status`** — time, item count, nights kept, last error —
  through the boot, for admins only (`backupStatus_`): Admin home's "Last backup"
  line, and a bell warning (`backupLate_`) when the last good run is over 36 hours
  old or a run failed after it. Nothing in the app can read, download or restore a
  backup: it holds PIN hashes and the anonymous health answers. Keep it that way.
- **Restoring** is `scripts/restore-backup.mjs` (`list` / `show <day>` /
  `restore <day> <keys…|--all> [--yes]`), run by hand with `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and
  `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` in the environment — never commit either. Without `--yes` it is a
  dry run; with it, it first snapshots now as `day/<today>~before-restore` (so the
  restore can be undone), writes only keys that differ, and never deletes a key the
  night lacked. A snapshot does not change "Last backup".
- **Same Netlify account.** This protects against bad writes, bugs and hand-edits —
  not against losing the Netlify site or account. An off-site copy would need
  credentials somewhere else; not set up.
- A scheduled function cannot be called by URL on the live site; Netlify's function
  page has "Run now". Scheduled functions get 30 seconds — `status.ms` says how long
  a night took; watch it if the store grows a lot.

## Deploy rules — do not break
- **CI gates pull requests.** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the suite as two
  checks — `server tests` (seconds, no install) and `browser tests` (Playwright +
  Chromium) — on every PR and every push to `main`. Both are the ones to require in
  branch protection. A green CI is not permission to skip running the suite locally:
  a merge here is a production deploy.
- **Netlify:** push to `main` → auto-deploy (GitHub integration on the `transcendent-crostata-c9b7f4`
  site). `netlify.toml` sets `publish = "public"` and `functions = "netlify/functions"`.
  Nothing else to run by hand.
- **Leadership gate:** `isLeader_` in `api.js` checks the caller's code against
  `process.env.GP_LEADER_CODE` and fails closed — no hardcoded fallback, since this
  repo is public and a literal in source would be a permanently known password. Gates
  reads of `SENSITIVE` metrics. If the env var is ever missing, leader access is off for
  everyone until it's restored.
- **Admin gate is a second, separate secret.** `isAdmin` (account approval/deactivation/
  PIN reset/fixing a wrong campus-dept, the Admin screen in `teams.html`) is deliberately
  not gated by the leader code above — Uriah asked for the two kept apart, since the
  dashboard is due for its own rework later and admin access shouldn't be tangled up in
  that. `grantAdmin` checks `process.env.GP_ADMIN_CODE` instead (`isAdminCode_` in
  `api.js`), same fail-closed shape. A Campus Leadership account spends it on itself once
  (Profile & settings → Admin access) or an existing admin spends it on someone else
  (the Admin screen) — `grantAdmin` only ever promotes a Campus Leadership account.
- **OKR writes have two doors** (`okrWriter_`): the leader code writes any objective, and
  a signed-in staff member (username + PIN) writes **their own campus and department
  only**. Two things make that a real boundary rather than a hopeful one — the campus and
  department are taken from the **staff record**, never from the payload, so a crafted
  request cannot claim another department; and an existing objective is only writable if it
  already belongs to that campus and department, so an id cannot be used to hijack another
  team's. 13 checks in the test suite cover it against the real handler.
  **Consequence to know:** this is department-level, so any staff member in a department
  can edit or delete that department's objectives — there is no per-person ownership,
  because the OKR record has no owner field. Narrowing it (to department leaders only, or
  per-ministry objectives) means adding a field to the record and to the dashboard's form.
- **One-time migration handler removed.** The Google-Sheet-to-Blobs migration used a
  secret-gated `adminSeed` handler in `api.js`; it's been deleted now that the migration
  is done. Never commit real staff/survey data (PIN hashes, photos, health-survey
  answers) to this repo — if a future migration needs it again, write a throwaway
  handler, use it once, and delete it.

## My Home's card stays one size while it loads (Oct 2026)
Uriah, twice: "the card on My Home is smaller and then gets big". Four causes, each fixed
and held by tests/test-hero-steady-ui.mjs:
- the base figures at its foot used to arrive with the boot — the strip is drawn from the
  start with a dash for each (`homeBaseHtml_`); a figure only counts up when it changes;
- this week's chore / cooking line (`schedHomeHtml_`) came from a second request after the
  card was drawn — **the boot carries `schedules`** (getMySchedules' answer, this week) and
  `applyBoot` adopts it when its week is this phone's `dutyWeekOf()`; so the kept copy has
  it too. Only without it does bindSched_ still ask;
- just signed in, the card was drawn before the boot landed — `afterLogin` keeps the
  "Impact Loading" coin up until it does (at most 3 s, then draws as before);
- the fonts came from Google Fonts after the first paint and Koulen grew every heading —
  **the fonts are the app's own**: `public/fonts/` (Koulen and Kantumruy Pro, Google's
  subsets, SIL OFL), `@font-face` with their unicode-ranges in teams.html's head,
  `font-display:block`, the Latin faces (and, for a Khmer reader, the Khmer body face)
  preloaded, all five in sw.js's PRECACHE. help.html and the portal still use Google Fonts.

## 360 reviews (☰ → 360 reviews, Oct 2026)
Uriah: "an anonymous 360 peer review option that we can send to a group of our peers or
leadership team and then store the results and create an action plan that comes from it
with quarterly reviews on progress." teams/10-review360.js; api.js "360 reviews" (`p360*`).
- **A staff member reviews themselves**: picks at least `P360_MIN_N` (3) people — anyone on
  staff on either campus, or an Advisory Board member with their own board login (board mode
  has the view to answer; BOARD_VIEWS) — with quick picks (their campus's leadership team,
  YWAM GP's, the board, their department, their mentor), a title, until when, a note. They
  answer the same questions about themselves (`self`). Nine areas, 1 rarely – 5 always or
  "don't know" (`P360_QS`: faith, vision, care, comms, team, reliable, humble, decide,
  culture), and keep / start / stop / anything else in words.
- **Anonymous by construction** (the server's, tests/test-p360.mjs): an answer is stored with
  no id and no time, spliced in at a random place; who has answered is a separate sorted
  `done` list (and `declined`), used only to stop a second answer and never sent to anyone —
  the person sees "4 of 6 answered". **Results only once closed** (by the person, or past
  its date — live results would let a change be matched to whoever just answered) **and from
  3+ answers**; an area rated by fewer than 3 shows no average; comments are shuffled per
  question on every read, so one person's answers can't be read across. Nobody in the app,
  an admin included, can see who said what. Honest limit: someone with direct access to the
  database and its nightly backups could compare snapshots in time — keep that access tight.
- **Results** (`p3ResultsHtml_`): each area, others' average (bar, `--vizIn`) against your
  own (mark, `--vizOut`), a table twin; strengths and to-grow-in (top / bottom 3); where you
  see yourself differently (|self − others| ≥ 1); the comments.
- **Action plan and quarterly reviews**: actions { area, what, measure (how I'll know), by
  (YYYY-Qn) } (`p360SavePlan`, ≤12), each suggested from a growth area; every quarter a
  review of every action — not started / on track / stuck / done, a note — and a reflection
  (`p360Review`, `plan.reviews['YYYY-Qn']`). My Home's tile (`p3TileHtml_`, boot `p360` from
  `p360Glance_`) says when feedback is waiting or a plan's review is due; the daily reminder
  carries both (`p360ask`, and on Mondays `p360plan`).
- **Sharing**: the person picks who else sees the results, their own answers and the plan
  (`p360Share`, ≤10; their mentor first) — read-only, never who was asked. They can delete it.
- Store: `p360` (one list), written with `mutateKey_` (mutateStaff_'s write-and-check, for
  any key) so two answers at once can't lose one.
- Tests: tests/test-p360.mjs (the server, anonymity), test-p360-ui.mjs (the whole journey).

## Conventions / must-preserve
- **Khmer-first.** Khmer is never smaller/lighter than English. All KPI/ministry/department
  NAMES come from the reviewed `BUILTIN_KM` dictionary in `public/km.js`.
- **Khmer prose needs human review** (native speakers Sreilea / Leakha). The rule used
  to be "never machine-translate into km.js"; Uriah asked for the backlog to be
  translated anyway, having been told what that trades away, so the rule is now
  narrower and stricter about where things go: **never put an unreviewed string into
  `REVIEWED_KM`.** New strings go into `PENDING_KM`, and move up only once a native
  speaker has read them. `docs/khmer-needed.md` is the review checklist, with notes on
  how each string is used — several are labels with very little room, and a few are
  promises the app makes about privacy, which are worth checking first.
- **A translation nobody can see is not a translation.** `t()` falls back to the English
  key, so a `t('...')` whose string is missing from the dictionary renders English and
  nothing complains. Worse, a *literal* that was never wrapped in `t()` at all can never
  be translated. `test-khmer.mjs` walks the source for both cases and fails on either —
  it is what found ~50 strings the hand-written backlog had missed, and it catches
  `t(cond ? 'a' : 'b')`, which a naive scan does not.
- **Never regenerate the base64 blobs in `logo.js`** — they are the real brand assets, not
  placeholder art. Edit in place; don't "tidy" or re-encode them.
- Uploaded files from macOS TextEdit may arrive as RTF — convert to plain text first.
- Brand: Paper #FAF6F0, Ink #17150F, Cobalt #1F44FF, Marigold #FFB323. Fonts: Koulen +
  Kantumruy Pro (Khmer), Archivo + Hanken Grotesk (Latin). Motif: ✦ spark.

## The front door (index.html)
Anyone not signed in, who hasn't chosen to browse as a guest, gets a welcome screen
first: **Create my profile** → `teams.html?reg=1`, **I already have a profile** →
`teams.html`, or **View as guest** → `teams.html?guest=1`, My YWAM GP's guest mode (it used
to open this dashboard; see "Looking around without an account"). It renders before the data arrives, so the dashboard never flashes
behind it.

Guests get every reading screen. The two writing views — **Log Numbers** and
**Health** — show a "this part needs an account" panel instead of the form, and carry
a 🔒 in the tab bar. Locked tabs stay visible on purpose: a guest should see what an
account would get them.

**This is a UI gate, not a server one.** `saveEntries` in `api.js` still accepts an
unauthenticated POST. It stops the accident — a number logged by nobody, against
nobody's campus — not a determined person. Closing it properly means passing staff
credentials into `saveEntries` and checking them server-side.

**Campus is a default, not yet a lock.** `saveStaffCard` records your campus and the
dashboard opens on it (`myCampus()`), so a Siem Reap staff member doesn't land on
Poipet's log form. Still switchable — reading across campuses is normal. The hard
lock ("you may only log your own campus") waits until everyone has an account;
until then it would shut real people out.

## 1-on-1s: a check-in, a sheet, two a month (Oct 2026)
Uriah: "formalize one-on-ones just a little bit more". Same `oneOnOnes` store; a row now
also carries `menteeId`, the mentee's `prep`, and once it happened `heldOn`, `notes` and
`followUps` ([{text, done}]). Status: pending → accepted → **held** (or declined).
- **The mentee's check-in** (`prep`): six areas of life — `money` (fundraising &
  finances), `language`, `physical`, `emotional`, `relational`, `spiritual` — and YWAM GP's
  five values, **FIGHT**: `faithful`, `innovative`, `generous`, `humble`, `tenacious`,
  each 1-5 — the form shows each value's statement and three "I…" behaviours, with its
  verse and guardrail (what it is not) under a fold, and `OO_FLOW` (how the five build:
  Faithful → Innovative → Generous → Humble → Tenacious) under the heading. FIGHT v2
  (Oct 2026, with Uriah): unity and "nation over location" under Generous, walking in the
  light (1 John 1) under Humble, grit and hear-obey under Tenacious. English and Khmer
  side by side in `OO_VALUES` (not through t()); YWAM GP's Khmer value names stay as YWAM GP has
  them (ការចុះចូល = submitting to and honouring one another). The FIGHT guide in the
  Library follows the same v2 text; plus `helpWith`, `workingOn` (personal goals) and `other`. A mentee's ☕ opens
  the form and the request carries it; when the mentor asks, the mentee is taken to it
  on accepting (`ooAfterAccept_`) and the bell nudges until it is filled. It starts from
  their last answers, and the summary shows ▲▼ against last time. Only the mentee can
  write it (`saveOneOnOnePrep`), until it is held.
- **Mentorship page (Oct 2026, Uriah: "one area for easy access")**: `S.view='mentor'` with no
  mentee open is **Mentorship** (`mentorHtml`): 1-on-1 requests waiting on you, saying who asked
  whom (`ooAskedYouText_`), away requests, mentor requests, 1-on-1s coming up, **People you
  mentor** (`.mentorRow`, tap → their page; ☕ "Ask {name} for a 1-on-1" or "Open the 1-on-1"),
  and **Your mentor** (`#myMentorCard`, ask button + your last 1-on-1s). The dashboard's Mentor
  row, My Home's short Mentorship card (`#goMentorshipHome`) and Team's `#goMentor` all open it
  (`[data-gomentorship]`). A mentee's page starts with **1-on-1 history** (`#ooHistory`,
  `ooHistRowHtml_`: coming up, then held newest first with notes and follow-ups done; Show all
  past 10) and "Ask {name} for a 1-on-1" / "Log one you already had" (`data-oolog`). The sheet
  says who is who ("You mentor Sokha" / "Andrew is your mentor") and whose request it is.
- **The sheet** (`S.view='oneonone'`, `oneOnOneHtml`, `ooGo_(id, withId)`): the
  check-in, the mentee's SMART goals for the year (the mentor's copy via
  getMenteeLogs), last time's follow-ups to tick (either of the pair), and for the
  mentor the date, notes and "to follow up next time" → **Mark as done**
  (`saveOneOnOneNotes`). A mentor can also **log** one that happened without a request
  (`logOneOnOne`). Drafts live on `S.ooDrafts` / `S.ooNotes`, so a re-render never loses
  typing.
- **Two a month** (`OO_PER_MONTH`), counted by `heldOn`: ●○ dots on My Home's Mentorship
  card (each mentee, and your own), on the Mentor page and on a mentee's page (which also
  lists their 1-on-1s). The monthly health question "2 one-on-ones?" shows the count.
  Department pulse counts held ones by `heldOn` (accepted older rows by decision date).
- **Privacy:** the check-in, notes and follow-ups go to the mentee always and to the
  mentor only while still their approved mentor (`ooPairNow_`); nobody else gets the
  rows, and leadership only ever a count. tests/test-one-on-one.mjs (API, 30),
  tests/test-one-on-one-ui.mjs (27).

## Health lives on the staff page
The weekly health section sits on My YWAM GP's **Health** tab. Reading order: **my
check-in** for the chosen week, **against last week** question by question, **my
weeks** (every week I've answered, newest first), then **the base average** my week
feeds — score for the week and YTD, check-in rate, and the per-question averages
and shares.

**The weekly check-in is the only thing that scores a week (Uriah, Oct 2026).** The
eleven questions are a form on the Health tab (`saveMyWeek`), one survey row per person
per week keyed by their `surveyToken`. The daily roll-up is gone: `saveDaily` still
records a day's habits for the Habit Tracker but writes no survey row (`syncWeekSurvey_`,
`weekSurveyFrom_` and `MIN_WEEK_DAYS` were removed). Rows the old roll-up wrote stay as
history, tagged "from daily logs"; answering that week by hand replaces them. My Home's
health card and the top "My Health" figure read **weekly check-ins only**
(`weeklyCheckin_`, `homeHealth_`): this week's once answered, last week's until then,
never a rolled-up week. tests/test-weekly-health-only.mjs, test-weekly-health-home-ui.mjs.

**Who sees what — the token is the whole mechanism.** Survey rows carry a token and
never a name, so anything pooled base-wide is anonymous *by construction*, not by
policy. Only the person's own staff record maps that token back to them, and
`getMenteeLogs` is the one place that join happens — so their **ONE approved
mentor** sees their answers with their name on them, and nobody else does.
Leadership reads the base total; it never reads an individual's answers. A
teammate's page (`staffProfile`) carries no health answers at all. 15 checks cover
this against the real handler, including that a non-mentor and a *pending* mentor
request are both refused, and that `getData` survey rows are nameless.

**One sanctioned exception: department totals (Uriah, Oct 2026).** `getDeptPulse`
joins a department's staff to their tokens *on the server* and returns exactly two
numbers per week — how many answered, and the average health score
(`compositeOf_`, mirrored from taxonomy.js and test-checked) — never a row, a token,
a name or an answer, and **no score at all under `PULSE_MIN_N` (3) answers**, so a
small department cannot single anyone out. Only the department's own Campus
Leadership leader, the Campus Director and admins can call it. tests/test-dept-pulse.mjs
asserts nothing of a check-in leaves the server. Do not widen this: no per-question
breakdown, no per-ministry split, no lowering the minimum.

**Consequence to know:** the dashboard has no per-question health breakdown and no
all-campuses view of it — a staff member's Health tab shows their own campus. The
base health *score* is still on the dashboard hero and on Base. The anonymous
device survey is gone for good: it was keyed by a random device id rather than a
person, so it could neither be attributed to a mentor nor prevented from
double-counting someone who also logged days. `saveSurvey` has been removed: it
wrote to the health blob with no authentication at all and nothing called it.

## What the dashboard leads with
The dashboard answers the questions leadership actually asks, in this order — each
section is a roll-up over existing weekly entries, nothing new is stored:

1. **The hero** — Total Staff is the headline number, with check-in rate and health
   score under it. Salvations YTD sits in the same black card as the sub-figure,
   quarters and all. Staff leads because it is the number every other figure on the
   page is produced by; salvations were the headline before and stayed in the card
   rather than being demoted to a tile.
2. **Leadership Development schools** — schools running, students enrolled, graduated
   YTD, potential staff, plus Q1–Q4 enrolment chips. Rolls up
   `LD_SCHOOL_MINISTRIES` (GPDTS/DTS, DBS, SMS, BCS, SOMD).
3. **Community schools** — `CS_SCHOOL_MINISTRIES` (GP Education, Ponlork, LTN,
   Sry Noi) counting `Students Enrolled` + `YE_SCHOOL_MINISTRIES` (YDC) counting
   `Youth Enrolled`. **Poipet runs two** (GP Education = YWAM GP Kids, YDC); **Siem Reap
   four** (Ponlork, LTN, Sry Noi, YDC — GP Education is Poipet's only, since Oct 2026;
   the dashboard label names only the schools the campus on show has). A ministry reporting its own `Schools` number contributes that instead of 1,
   so a multi-site ministry counts honestly; otherwise any ministry with data at all
   counts as the one school it is — nobody should have to log "1" every week for YDC.
4. **Outreach teams** — `Teams Hosted`, volunteers, volunteer hours, people served,
   and outreach-scoped salvations / baptisms / church connections, plus Q1–Q4 chips.
5. **Local church partnerships** — `Partner Churches Supported` + `Churches Being Led`
   as one "Local Churches Partnered" figure, then congregation attendance, people
   connected to a local church, and `Spoke at Churches` from Campus Leadership.
6. **Across every ministry** — base-wide baptisms, gospel hearings, healings.

The group constants live in `taxonomy.js` so the log form and the dashboard cannot
drift apart. Adding a school means adding its ministry to one of those three arrays.
`ministryRollup` respects each metric's own `modeOf` rule, which is what keeps
enrolment from being summed week after week.

Two aggregation corrections came with this: `Partner Churches Supported` and
`Combined Congregation Attendance` moved into `LATEST_SET`. Both are levels, not
weekly events — summing them counted the same church (and the same congregation)
again every week it was re-entered.

`Teams Hosted` is a **new** metric on Community Service → Outreach Teams. It sums,
so it answers "how many teams did we host this year" directly rather than being
inferred from volunteer counts.

## Key behaviors
- **Health score** (`compositeOf` in Index.html): averages per-item scores; loneliness is
  INVERTED (`10 - lonely`) so lower loneliness raises the score. Porn/debt count as 0 when present.
- **Weekly trends:** ▲/▼ % vs the previous week; green = good, red = bad. "Lower is better"
  metrics (staff debt, expenses, loneliness, porn, students struggling) invert the color.
- **Photos** are stored inline (data URI) in the Staff sheet — no Google Drive (that avoids
  the scope/auth error and keeps them small, ~300px).
- **Sensitive Teams data** (loneliness, porn, debt) is returned by name only to the person and
  their ONE chosen mentor (server-enforced in getMenteeLogs); leadership sees aggregates only.
- The dashboard intentionally omits "New Churches Planted" and "Base Plants in Planning"
  (still loggable in their ministries, just not shown on the dashboard summary).
- **A weekly goal's progress is a percentage, not a tick.** Ministry work is rarely
  finished-or-not — you discipled two of the three students you meant to — and a
  checkbox made people round an honest 60% to one of two lies. With three goals, a
  week could also only ever read 0, 33, 67 or 100%. Each goal now stores `pct`
  (0-100, step 5 in the UI) and the week is the **average** of what moved. `done` is
  still returned, derived as `pct >= 100`.
  **Rows written before this store `done` and no `pct`** — always read them through
  `goalItemPct_` (server) / `goalItemPct` (client), which maps a ticked goal to 100
  and an unticked one to 0. Reading `.pct` directly would silently zero every goal
  the team has already completed; `test-goals.mjs` covers exactly that.
  Progress and colour are shared: `pctColor` grades amber → blue → green as the
  number climbs, `pctWord` says the same thing in words for anyone who cannot pick
  those colours apart, and `ringVars`/`ringHtml` drive both the ring and the slider
  track from one string. Dragging repaints locally and saves once on release —
  never re-render mid-drag, or the thumb jumps out from under a finger.
- **The app is locked to the edges of the phone.** All three pages ask for
  `viewport-fit=cover` and a `black-translucent` status bar, which hands them the
  notch and the home-indicator strip as well as the screen. Every page therefore
  pads by `env(safe-area-inset-*)`: header top, body bottom/left/right, the staff
  tab bar, and the pull-to-refresh coin. Without it the header sat under the notch
  and the chrome shifted every time iOS re-reported the insets — on rotation, on
  keyboard open/close, when the URL bar collapsed — which reads as the app
  wiggling. **Watch for media queries**: `index.html` re-declares `header` padding
  under `max-width:480px`, so the inset has to be in that rule too or the fix does
  nothing on the one class of device that has insets. `overflow-x:hidden` is on
  `html` as well as `body`, because on iOS `body` alone still lets the document
  rubber-band sideways. `test-chrome.mjs` asserts all of it.
- **Colours come from tokens; there is no raw palette hex left.** The theme block
  (`/* ==================== THEME TOKENS ====================`) is duplicated verbatim
  in **all three** pages and `test-theme.mjs` asserts the copies are byte-identical —
  **edit one, edit all**. It is read in `<head>` before the stylesheet, and the saved
  choice is applied there too, or the app flashes the wrong colours on every open.
  Three states: no `data-theme` attribute follows the system, `light`/`dark` is the
  reader's choice and wins both ways. That is why the media query is guarded with
  `:not([data-theme="light"])`. The control lives in **Profile & settings** on the
  staff page (Appearance: Auto / Light / Dark, stored in `gp-theme`).
  **Four pairs of tokens must never be collapsed**, because each value was doing two
  jobs in the old palette and a blind find-and-replace inverts them:
  `--ink` (body text) vs `--headerBg` (header, hero, coin — dark in BOTH themes);
  `--surface` (cards) vs `--onDark` (text on that dark header);
  `--faint` (tertiary text on paper) vs `--onDarkFaint` (tertiary text on the hero);
  and anything sitting on `--accent`/`--amber` needs `--accentInk`/`--amberInk`, not
  the page's text colour. Three of those four were found by the contrast audit, not
  by eye — the hero rings, the campus chip and the KPI guide's amber buttons all had
  light text on a light fill in one theme or the other.
  **`test-theme.mjs` walks every text node on every screen in both themes** and fails
  anything under WCAG AA, working out each element's real background by climbing until
  it finds an opaque one. It also caught three contrast failures that predated dark
  mode, so `--faint`, `--amberDeep` and `--warm` are darker than they used to be.
  Run it after any colour change; do not chase contrast by looking at screenshots.
- **Pull-to-refresh is `gpPullToRefresh(onRefresh, opts)` in `rollup.js`, once.** Both
  pages had their own copy and the copies drifted twice — first the staff coin had no
  mark in it, then it did not *turn* as you pulled, which is what made the gesture feel
  broken there. The rotation during the drag (`rotate(px * 3)deg`) is the part that
  makes the coin feel attached to your finger; on release the inline transform is
  **cleared** so the CSS spin animation can take over, which the dashboard's own copy
  had never done. `onRefresh` must return a promise or the coin never stops.
- **A figure opens a breakdown only if the breakdown would ADD UP to it.** That is the
  whole rule. Students, discipleship and partner churches are sums of rows, so they
  open and the sheet totals the tile exactly. "Schools" is a count of ministries
  reporting, and Total Volunteer Hours is Σ(hours × volunteers) — a sheet under either
  would show rows totalling something other than the headline, which is worse than not
  opening. `test-pull-drill.mjs` opens a group sheet and asserts its rows sum to the
  tile, so this cannot rot.
  Figures summed across a **set** of ministries or **two** metrics use
  `gpDrillGroupAttrs(metricOrMetrics, ids, ministries, label, quarter)` — community
  students spans two departments *and* two metrics (Students Enrolled + Youth Enrolled),
  which is why those tiles used to be closed for want of a filter rather than by choice.
- **Tappable figures must look tappable.** `.drillable` was `cursor:pointer` and nothing
  else, which is invisible on a phone — so which numbers opened was guesswork, and the
  ones deliberately closed looked identical to broken ones. Tappable numbers now carry a
  dotted accent underline and tiles a ▸ marker. A test asserts both, on both pages.
- **Shared UI atoms live at the bottom of `rollup.js`.** `gpRingHtml`/`gpRingVars`/
  `gpPctColor`/`gpPctWord` (the progress rings, `sm`/`lg` sizes, colour walking warm →
  amber → cobalt → green with a word saying the same thing), `gpTap` (haptics —
  Android buzzes, iOS Safari ignores `vibrate()`, so it can only ever be a bonus and
  must never carry meaning), `gpAnimateCounts` (the count-up, which was already
  written for the dashboard and only lived there), and `gpShareCard` (a week as a
  canvas PNG through the OS share sheet). teams.html keeps thin wrappers
  (`ringHtml` → `gpRingHtml`) so its call sites read unchanged.
  The rings' CSS is in the shared theme block, not per page, so a ring looks the same
  wherever it appears — including the override that makes its digits `--onDark` inside
  the black hero.
  `gpShareCard` checks `navigator.canShare({files})` rather than assuming: file
  sharing is missing on older browsers, and a `download` attribute does nothing on
  iOS, so the fallback opens the PNG to be long-pressed and the return value says
  which happened (`shared` / `cancelled` / `opened` / `blocked` / `unsupported`).
- **The launch splash is one block, duplicated verbatim in both pages.** Look for
  `<!-- ==================== SPLASH ====================` at the top of the body in
  `index.html` and `teams.html`; `test-splash.mjs` asserts the two copies are
  byte-identical, so **edit one, edit both**. It is inlined rather than pulled from
  a file because it must paint on the first frame, and an external stylesheet is
  another round trip — which is the very thing it exists to hide.
  Why it exists: `start_url` used to be `index.html`, so **every launch loaded the
  dashboard and then navigated to the staff page** — a second real network fetch. It now
  points at `teams.html`, so an installed app opens straight on the staff page and that
  hand-off does not happen at all. The splash still matters, because opening the
  dashboard *link* (or a leader tapping "Dashboard") can still cross between the two. No amount of script timing fixes that; the splash is in the
  markup from the first byte, `position:fixed`, opaque, `z-index:9999`, ahead of the
  header, so there is nothing to see underneath at any point on any engine. Its
  background is the manifest's `background_color`, so the iOS launch screen hands
  over with no flash of white or paper.
  The ring is a masked `conic-gradient` spinning from CSS alone, because `logo.js`
  is **77KB and must never block the head**; the real mark fades in via
  `gpSplashLogo(GP_LOGO)` the moment it lands. `gpSplashDone()` takes it down and is
  called from `render()` on both pages and from both error boundaries — and it also
  lifts itself after 8s, so a path that forgets to call it cannot trap a working app
  behind a splash.
  `window.gpLeaving` is set when the dashboard redirects: it makes `render()` return
  early (so the dashboard is never drawn or unveiled) and skips `fetchData()`, which
  would otherwise spend a Netlify invocation on a screen nobody sees, once per staff
  member per app open.
  **Testing note:** Chromium never paints the document it is navigating away from —
  `evaluate()` there throws "execution context destroyed" — so frame-timing
  assertions about the flash pass even with no splash present. WebKit on iOS *does*
  paint it, which is why the flash was visible on a phone and never in the harness.
  The assertions that actually hold the fix run with **scripts disabled** and check
  the splash covers the viewport and the header underneath is unreachable. Do not
  "simplify" those into timing checks.
- **The staff redirect lives in `<head>`.** A signed-in staff member opening
  `index.html` is sent to `teams.html`, and that check must run above every byte of
  body markup — it touches no DOM for exactly that reason. It used to sit in a
  script below the header, after the blocking `<script src>` tags, so the browser
  had already painted the dashboard chrome: staff saw the dashboard flash for
  ~200ms on every app open.
- **Every "we are loading" state is the spinning GP mark.** Boot screen, pull-to-refresh
  coin, and the header refresh button all use `@keyframes spin` on the real logo. The
  refresh button used to swap in a "…", which read as nothing happening and stayed
  there forever when a request failed, since only a successful render put the ↻ back.
  If you add a busy state, spin the mark and restore it in both branches.
  The staff boot coin is **built by JS** once `logo.js` is in, not written as body
  markup. As markup it was an `<img>` with no `src` until that script ran, so on a
  slow connection you watched an empty ring spin with a hole in it. An empty
  `<main>` for a few ms looks like nothing; a hollow coin looks broken. The
  dashboard already did it this way (it builds its loading box in `render()`), and
  the two now match — do not move either back into static markup.

## Known limits (real, not yet fixed)
- **No locking on read-modify-write.** Every write reads a whole blob, edits it and writes
  it back. Two people saving the same sheet in the same second means one loses. Rare at
  this team size, real nonetheless.
  - **A request reads its own writes, and that is load-bearing.** `readJSON`/`writeJSON`
    share a per-request scope (`AsyncLocalStorage` — see the comment on `readJSON`), so
    anything a request writes is what that same request reads back. Without it, a handler
    that answers by calling its matching read function — `saveMyKpiDay` ends with
    `getMyMinistry`, `saveTrip` with `getMyTrips` — can be served a version older than the
    write it just made, and the client faithfully paints the old value back. That was one
    root cause behind a family of reports that all sounded different: a habit tile
    unticking itself, a week total that stays put after you type today's figure, a leave
    request that only appears after a reload. Thirteen write paths were affected.
    `tests/test-read-your-writes.mjs` runs them all against a store whose reads
    deliberately lag its writes; a strongly-consistent fake hides the whole class, which
    is why every other test passed while this was broken. The scope must stay
    **per-request** — a module-level cache would let one invocation read another's writes
    on a warm instance, which is worse than the bug it fixes.
- **A week belongs to a week year, and late December can be next year's week 1.**
  The app's week 1 is the Monday–Sunday week holding 1 January (its own rule, not ISO
  8601), so 28–31 December 2026 are week 1 of **2027** — they used to compute as "week
  53" of 2026 and clamp onto the real week 52. `weekYearOf(d)` / `thisWeekYear()` in
  teams.html and `weekYear_` / `thisWeekYear_()` in api.js say which year a date's week is in; `isoWeekOf` still
  returns just the number, and `mondayOfWeek_(week, year)` / `weekRange_` /
  `weekBounds_` take an optional year that defaults to this week year. Anything that
  pairs a year with a week uses the week year; dates (leave, birthdays, contracts,
  SMART goals, the org chart's quarters) keep the calendar one. The server's
  `yearForWeek_(wk)` decides the year of a bare week the page sends: week 51/52 in
  weeks 1–2 is last year's (so backfilling the week just gone in early January no
  longer lands on the new year), week 1 on the Sunday before next year's week 1 is
  next year's (a phone slightly ahead), anything else this week year's — all on
  Cambodia's calendar (`baseToday_`), not UTC. Reads with no year (`getData`, goals,
  check-ins, My Ministry) default to this week year. **Still clamped, on purpose:**
  when next year's 1 January is a Monday (2023→2024, 2029→2030) the last seven days of
  December are a 53rd week that is nobody's week 1, and they stay on week 52 of their
  own year — rare, and week 53 exists nowhere in the app. "Last week" from week 1 is
  still week 0 (nothing), as every January. Test: `tests/test-week-year.mjs`.
- **~4,000 Khmer strings are translated but unreviewed** (`PENDING_KM` in `km.js`). They
  are on screen now rather than sitting in English, which was Uriah's call, but nobody
  who speaks Khmer has read them yet. **Khmer review** (below) is how they get read.

## Prayer requests (☰ → Prayer, Oct 2026)
- Share a request with **my campus**, **all of YWAM GP**, or **only my mentor** (an accepted
  one); `prCanSee_` decides, and the server only ever returns what you may see. "I prayed"
  is a count (`prayedN`, `iPrayed`) — who prayed is never sent. The asker marks it answered
  (with an optional line of thanks) or deletes it; an admin can delete too. Five a day each.
- `prayers` blob; open requests show for 60 days, answered for 30 (your own always), rows
  older than a year drop on the next new request. Not in the roster or any report.
- tests/test-prayer-ui.mjs.

## Support raising (My Home → Support raising, Oct 2026)
- Each staff member's ministry partners and monthly goal (US$), on their own staff record
  (`support`: { goal, partners[{ id, name, amount, freq month|year|once, status
  giving|asked|toask|paused, last, note, channel }], giving[{ id, name, amount, freq,
  channel, location, note }], mentorVisible }), `getMySupport` /
  `saveMySupport` (whole list, via mutateStaff_; max 300). **Private like debt**: never in
  the roster, staffProfile, admin or HR lists, or anyone's boot but your own (your boot has
  only your totals, `supportSummary`, for the My Home tile).
- **The mentor sees totals only, and only with consent** (`mentorVisible`, "My mentor can see
  these totals — never the names"): getMenteeLogs' `support` is `supportSummary_` — goal,
  pledged a month, % of goal, counts giving / asked / to ask, and how many to thank or
  follow up. Partner names never leave the person's account. Leadership sees nothing.
- Pledged a month = giving partners: monthly as is, yearly / 12, once not counted.
  "To thank or follow up": not paused and not in touch for `SUP_FOLLOW_DAYS` (90), or asked
  with no contact date (a giving partner without one — e.g. just brought in — isn't flagged).
- **We support** (Oct 2026, Uriah: "make the support tab include who we're supporting
  monthly"): the second tab, `giving` — the people and ministries the person gives to, by
  channel (via GP, via ABA …) and place. The top card then shows coming in / going out /
  kept a month (`givenMonthly`, own page only). **As private as the partners, and more**:
  in no summary — the mentor's totals are the partners' alone.
- **Bringing in a tracker** ("can you automatically put this into my profile"): the
  person's own Giving & Support Tracker (a Google Sheets PDF export, or its rows pasted)
  is read on the page — `GP_FIN.parseSupportTracker` in finance.js, pdf.js via
  `finPdfRows_` — from its two lists, "Monthly Support Received" (Channel · Donor / Church ·
  Monthly $ · Notes) and "Monthly Support Given" (Channel · Recipient · Location · Monthly
  $), a list running on to the next page without headings, each ending at its TOTAL
  (checked); the month-by-month trackers after them are ignored. Previewed, then "Add to
  my lists": same channel + name updates, new ones are added (partners as giving, monthly).
  Never commit anyone's tracker — tests/fin-fixtures.mjs `supportTracker()` is made up.
- **Language** needed nothing new: the "Language study" habit tile streaks, the weekly
  check-in has language hours, and the 1-on-1 check-in rates language 1–5.
- tests/test-support-ui.mjs (and the tracker parser in test-finance-parse.mjs).

## Your first 30 days (My Home, Oct 2026)
- For someone whose account is under `F30_DAYS` (45) old (`created`, now in the boot's own
  staff card — not the roster): a card above the goals with what makes a good start, every
  item read from what the app already knows — profile (photo, kind of staff, country), a
  mentor who accepted, the papers signed (`S.required.finished`), a first daily check-in, a
  first 1-on-1 held, FIGHT and Keeping Each Other Safe read, strengths, personality type,
  and reminders on (when the app has them and the phone can). Each row goes where it's done.
  Gone when all done, after 45 days, or "Hide this" (this phone, `gp-f30-hidden`).
- tests/test-first30-ui.mjs.

## Reminders — web push (Oct 2026)
- **Off until an admin turns them on**: Admin → Reminders → "Turn on reminders for the app"
  (`adminSetUpPush`) makes a P-256 key pair once and keeps it in the `pushKeys` blob,
  server-side only. GP_VAPID_PUBLIC / GP_VAPID_PRIVATE (raw base64url) / GP_VAPID_SUBJECT in
  Netlify's environment win if set. No keys → the boot's `push` is null and nothing shows.
- **Per phone**: Profile & settings → Reminders. iPhone needs the app opened from the Home
  Screen (iOS 16.4+), and says so. Subscribing uses the boot's public key; the server keeps
  `{ staffId, endpoint, p256dh, auth, lang }` in `pushSubs`, only for push services in
  `PUSH_HOSTS` (FCM, Mozilla, Apple, Windows) over https — so a subscription can never point
  the server elsewhere. Max 5 phones each. Prefs on the staff record (`push`: hour 05–22,
  daily, oneonone, admin, hr) — never in the roster.
- **netlify/functions/reminders.js, hourly** → `runReminders` (exported from api.js): each
  person whose hour it is (Phnom Penh) gets ONE notification listing what applies — today's
  check-in not in (daily); a mentee with fewer than 2 1-on-1s held this month, Mondays from
  the 8th (oneonone); sign-ups / moves into Campus Leadership waiting (admins); contracts
  ending soon, Mondays (HR). Nothing to say → nothing sent. `pushRun` stops an hour sending
  twice; a 404/410 from the push service drops that subscription.
- **No library**: VAPID (RFC 8292, ES256 via node crypto, `vapidJwt_`) and aes128gcm payload
  encryption (RFC 8291, `pushEncrypt_`). The notification text is `PUSH_TEXT` in api.js (en +
  draft km, chosen by the phone's language at subscribe time) — not km.js.
- sw.js shows it (`push`) and opens/focuses the app on a tap (`notificationclick`).
- tests/test-reminders.mjs (decrypts as a phone would, verifies the signature),
  tests/test-reminders-ui.mjs (a stood-in PushManager).

## Khmer review (☰ → Language → Khmer review, Oct 2026)
- For staff an admin ticks as **Khmer reviewer** (`kmReviewer`, Admin → staff) and admins
  (`isKmReviewer_`). One draft at a time from PENDING_KM (minus anything already in
  REVIEWED_KM): the English, the draft Khmer, where it is used, ✓ **Reads right** or
  ✏️ **Fix it**; Back / Skip; filters Not checked yet · Fixed · Reads right · All; search.
- Server: `getKmReview` / `saveKmReview(key, 'ok'|'fix'|'clear', km)`, one row per string
  in the `kmReview` blob (`{ key, verdict, km, by, byName, at }`). A fix must contain Khmer
  and keep exactly the English's `{placeholders}` (`kmSlots_`) — checked on both sides.
- **A fix is live for everyone at once**: the boot's `kmFixes` → `gpKmFixes_` writes them
  over BUILTIN_KM. That is a correction made by a person who reads Khmer, so it beats the
  draft; it is still not in REVIEWED_KM until it is built in.
- **Building in** (what makes it permanent, and the only bulk way into REVIEWED_KM): an
  admin taps "Download the checked phrases" (khmer-review-<date>.json) and a developer runs
  `node scripts/apply-km-review.mjs <file>` — "reads right" moves the draft as it is, a fix
  moves the reviewer's Khmer; both leave PENDING_KM. Commit km.js after.
- "Where it is used" comes from `public/km-notes.js`, built from docs/khmer-needed.md's
  headings by `node scripts/build-km-notes.mjs` (a hash of the English → section). Run it
  after adding a section to the doc. Loaded only on this screen.
- tests/test-km-review-ui.mjs.
- **The job-focus paragraphs are still English.** `public/jobfocus.js` (the KPI
  guide's one-line descriptions now have pending Khmer, in-app) carries 28 ministries' worth of prose — that is content rather
  than interface, it is long, and it reads as teaching material, so it wants a person
  writing it rather than a translation of the English.

**The habit grid is drawn from a config only the server can confirm.** The picker
writes the new list into `S.habits` and renders from it at once, but the server
only hears about it through `saveMyHabits`. If that never lands, the page is
drawing a habit the server has never heard of — and from there every daily save
cleans the tap against the config the *server* holds (`cleanHabitMap_`) and
answers with that same config, so the tile disappears from under the finger and
the next press lands on whatever slid into its place. So `_habitCfg` remembers
the last acknowledged list, `pushHabits()` puts it back and says so when a push
fails, and every response's habit config goes through `adoptHabits()` — which
declines while a change of our own is still in flight, because that answer is
older than what we asked for. `test-habit-config.mjs` holds it.

**A slider must not be a place the page won't scroll.** Every full-width control
is somewhere a thumb lands, so `touch-action` on one decides whether the page can
be scrolled from there. `none` forbids panning outright and `pan-x` permits only
the horizontal axis — both were in place, on the Health tab's 1-10 sliders and on
My Database's chip strip, and both read as "the app doesn't scroll on Android".
A horizontal control takes `pan-y`; a horizontal scroller takes `pan-x pan-y`.
Never `none`. The second half is that the browser moves a range input's value on
touch *down*, before it knows the gesture was a scroll — so scrolling past a
question answered it, and scrolling past Weekly Goals saved it. Every range input
goes through `gpSlideGuard()`, which puts the value and the caller's own state
back when the gesture turns out to have been a scroll. `test-touch-scroll.mjs` reads the
rules off computed style and drives the guard from the event sequence a real touch
produces. It also tries the gesture for real through CDP, but only after checking
that the same swipe can scroll plain page at all — Chromium 141 scrolls from a
dispatched touch sequence and 151 does not, so that layer reports skipped rather
than failing. A test that only passes on one browser build is the same problem as
one that only passes on one machine.

## Things that made the app fail to load (don't reintroduce)
Each of these looked harmless and took the whole page down. `test-degraded.mjs`,
`test-storage.mjs` and `test-firstrun.mjs` exist to keep them fixed.
- **A render-blocking font.** A pending stylesheet blocks script execution, so an
  `@import` of Google Fonts held JS for 8s on a slow connection. All three pages now load
  fonts with `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`. `audit-paint.mjs` asserts first
  paint stays under ~200ms even with the CDN hanging for 12s.
- **A third `<script src>`.** The error boundary treats a failed script as fatal, so
  extracting `logo.js` broke production. Optional scripts carry `data-optional` and the
  boundary skips them — and anything they define must be reached through a guard
  (`logoImg()`), because a bare `GP_LOGO` in a string is a ReferenceError.
- **Reading `localStorage` unguarded.** With storage blocked, `getItem` and `setItem`
  *throw* rather than returning null. `state` was being built from a bare `getItem`, so
  the page rendered nothing at all; `afterLogin()` wrote the session before anything else,
  so logging in silently did nothing but show "Connection problem". Both pages now go
  through `lsGet`/`lsSet`/`lsDel` — losing a saved preference is fine, losing the page is not.
- **A dead cache key deciding the language.** Khmer used to be fetched into `gp-km-v2`;
  nothing writes that key any more, but the read was still there with an English fallback,
  so every data load quietly reset a Khmer reader to English while the toggle still read
  ខ្មែរ. The dictionary ships with the page now — there is nothing to wait for.
- **A malformed request body.** `HANDLERS[body.fn]` threw on a bare `null` body (500) and
  resolved `fn:"constructor"` to `Object` and called it. Dispatch now needs an own
  property that is actually a function, and anything else is a 400.

## Deliberately NOT built
- **No Bible reading plan.** The team works through The Bible Recap together in a
  dedicated Bible app, so tracking day-by-day readings here would only duplicate it.
  Bible reading is simply one of the habit tiles with its own streak. A `bible-plan.js`
  with position tracking existed briefly and was removed — don't rebuild it.

## On the horizon (not yet built)
- **One page instead of two.** `index.html` and `teams.html` are converging: they now
  share `logo.js`, `km.js` and `taxonomy.js`, the same loading coin, the same header
  mark, and the front door hands off between them. The end state is a single page where
  the dashboard and your own space are two views, not two files. Whenever you touch
  chrome on one page, do the same on the other — the visible gap between them is the
  thing being closed.
- **The campus lock.** Logging is currently *defaulted* to your own campus, not locked
  to it (see The front door). Turning the default into a rule is blocked on staff who
  have no account yet: today it would lock them out entirely. Revisit once the roster
  is close to complete.
- **Server-side auth on `saveEntries`.** The account gate is UI-only. Pass the staff
  username + PIN through `saveEntries` and check them in `api.js`, so an unattributed
  number can't reach the blob at all. This is also what makes the campus lock real
  rather than cosmetic.


**Dates in tests** (`tests/clock.mjs`): a browser test whose fixtures depend on today must
build them from `testNow()` and pin the page to the same moment with `pinClock(pageOrContext,
now)` before the first goto (time is shifted, not frozen). Count quarters the app's way —
`quarterOf(weekOf(now))`, 13-week blocks of the week number — never from the month: on
28 Sep (week 40) the app is in Q4. A test whose fixtures are one fixed scenario pins itself
(`testNow('2026-08-12')`, as test-base does); one that should hold on any day uses
`testNow()` and is checked at the edges with `GP_TEST_NOW=YYYY-MM-DD node tests/<file>`.
A fixture that pairs a year with a week takes it from `weekYearOf(now)`, not
`getFullYear()`: on 30 December 2026 `weekOf` is 1 and the year is 2027.
- **Structure: the next quarter can be saved early** (`nextQuarter_`, `structIsNext_`, `structIsLive_` in teams.html): it shows the live chart like the current quarter, with "Save Q{n} {year} structure early" for admins, so the base can set up a quarter while planning it a couple of weeks ahead. Q4's next is Q1 of next year (the year picker then offers next year). The server already took any quarter from an admin.
- **Structure: staff who are students for a quarter** (`saveStructurePlan`, blob `structurePlans`, one row per campus / year / quarter: `students: {staffId: 'dts'|'dbs'|'bcs'|'sms'}`): set by an admin from Structure on the current or next quarter ("🎓 Students in Q4 2026"), for that quarter only — profiles are untouched. The chart moves them out of their ministry into a "Students this quarter" box by school; `saveStructure` writes `student` onto each snapshot person, and changing the plan updates a snapshot already saved. `getStructure` answers with `plan`. Portal applicant accounts are never on the chart: `saveStructure` skips them and `structPeopleOnly_` drops them from snapshots saved before that rule.
- **Leadership OKRs for everyone (Oct 2026, Uriah)**: the OKR tab of My Ministry shows a read-only
  "🧭 Leadership OKRs" section (`leadershipOkrsHtml_`, `#leadOkrs`, `[data-leadokrs="<campus>"]`):
  Campus Leadership's objectives for this quarter, your campus first, drawn with
  `okrCardHtml(o, R, false)` — no slider, no − / +, no Edit or Delete. Not shown to Campus
  Leadership (theirs are editable above) or admins (every department's, editable, below). The server
  already sent every objective to everyone (`getData`), and `okrWriter_` keeps writes to your own
  campus and department, so nobody else can change them.
- **Admins write every OKR** (`okrWriter_`): an active `isAdmin` account has the leader code's reach, so `saveObjective` / `deleteObjective` take its payload's campus and department. On the OKR tab, "Every department's OKRs" is editable for admins: Edit / Delete and the hand-tracked % on each card (cards sit inside `[data-okradmin]`, which is how Edit knows to keep that objective's own campus / department in `S.okrAdmin`), plus "+ New objective" with a campus and department picker. Everyone else stays pinned to their own campus and department.
- **A 'people' question** (form type `people`: a list of `{name, email, phone}`, add as many; optional `addLabel`): the team form's `coLeaders` ("Co-leaders", "+ Add a co-leader"), right after the team leader. Server `cleanPeople_` keeps rows with a name (up to 20, trimmed and cut); required means at least one. Page `peopleInputHtml_` / `bindPeople_` write through `ansStore_` like the trip, so it works in the applicant's form and in staff answer editing.
- **Structure is its own arrangement, separate from profiles** (`place` in each `structurePlans` row: `{staffId: {dept, ministry}}`): an admin taps "✏️ Arrange Q4 2026" on the current or next quarter, then drags a person (pointer events — mouse or finger; chips get `touch-action:none` while arranging) onto a ministry (`[data-drop="Dept|Ministry"]`), the Campus Director box or a department's Overseer spot, or taps them for the Move picker (`structMoveHtml_`). Each move saves at once via `saveStructurePlan(…, students, place)` — pass `null` for the part you are not changing; moving someone back to their profile's place drops them from the map; "Back to profiles" clears it. Profiles are never written. A quarter with no plan starts from the latest earlier arrangement (`planFor_` → `inherited`, `from`); students never carry over. The chart (`orgChartHtml_(campus, roster, students, place, arranging)`) and `saveStructure` both apply the arrangement; changing it updates a snapshot already saved. Leads (crowns) still come from profiles.
- **A mentor looks back at any week** (`mentorHtml`, `S.menteeWeek`): a ‹ Week N › picker on the mentee page (opens on their newest check-in week; "Back to the latest check-in"; the list of weeks is tappable). The check-in (against the one before it), habits (that week's days against the week before), weekly goals and daily logs all follow the picked week; a week without one says so. The server already sent the whole year (`getMenteeLogs`).

## Students in the GP app (Oct 2026)
- **Profiles from SR Hospitality.** ☰ → Operations → 🎓 Students (`canStudents_`: admin, HR, Hospitality,
  portal staff) lists who is booked as `category:'student'` now (`studentsList`). **Make profile**
  (`studentMakeProfile`) makes a student candidate (stage arrived, `source:'hospitality'`) with
  `portal.invite.token`; **Copy invite** copies `portal.html?join=<token>`. On that page the student signs
  in with Google (`portalJoin`) → an applicant account linked to the profile; the invite is spent.
- **The portal** shows their application as usual plus **📱 Go to GP app** (student-type only), which
  saves `gp-student` and opens `teams.html?student=1`.
- **Student mode is the real app**, same look, fewer parts: tabs My Home / Schedules / Library; My Home =
  hello + this week's schedule, weekly goals, habits, mentor, About me (strengths). No bell, no health,
  ministry, base, check-ins or support raising.
- **Their data never touches staff data.** Every call goes through one door, `studentCall(u,pin,fn,args)`,
  with an allowlist (`STUDENT_FNS`, mirrored client-side as `STUDENT_FNS_C`; anything else answers
  `{ok:false,err:'student'}` without a request). Writes go to the blob `stu:<accountId>` only. Schedules
  are read-only and published weeks only. Staff handlers still refuse applicants.
- **Mentors are Leadership Development only** (`STU_LD_DEPT`), names and photos only. A request sits in
  `stuIndex`; the mentor sees it on their Mentorship page (🎓 Students) and accepts or declines
  (`respondStudentMentor`). 1-on-1 forms for students are not built yet.
- **Admin → 🎓 Students is the one place for students** (admins only): who is staying now with Make
  profile / Copy invite (`stuStayingHtml_`, shared with ☰ → Students for HR/Hospitality), then each school,
  with **School finished? Archive these profiles** (`studentsArchive`: candidates archived, their GP app
  closes, the portal account stays). The old Arrivals & departures is split into two plain Admin cards:
  **Staff sign-up link** (`groups`) and **Archive several people** (`leaving`) — both staff only.
- **Admin → 🎓 Students** (admins only): every student profile by school (`studentsAdmin`), one student's
  mentor, goals (last/this/next week), habits, strengths and Library (`studentAdminView`), and **See their
  app**: their real student app, read only (`S.stuPreview` — `run()` sends nothing, Library marks are
  theirs and in memory; Back to Admin reloads as yourself, back on their profile via `gp-stu-back`).
- Tests: `tests/test-students.mjs` (server, the door and the access checks), `tests/test-student-app-ui.mjs`.
