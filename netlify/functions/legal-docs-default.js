/* The legal documents a team signs on arrival, as shipped — YWAM Siem Reap's
   own forms (Photo Release, Accident Waiver, Liability Release Waiver,
   Acceptance of Place), the English text copied word for word from the paper
   forms. The Khmer halves of the bilingual forms are not here yet.

   Each person on a team opens the team's signing link, picks their name and
   signs each document on their phone (portalSignOpen / portalSignSubmit in
   api.js). Where the paper form has a line to sign or initial, the page draws
   a box to sign in with a finger.

   Shape: { id, title, blocks:[...], sign:{ age, witness, guardian } }
   Blocks:
     { t:'h', text }                          a heading
     { t:'p', text, style:'bold'|'italic' }   a paragraph; {name} is the signer's name
     { t:'list', items:[text] }               bullet points (a leading "Word:" is bold)
     { t:'choice', id, options:[{id,text}] }  pick exactly one
     { t:'contacts' }                         the reporting contacts a portal admin sets
     { t:'check', id, text }                  a box they must tick
     { t:'group', id, title, items:[text] }   a ticked heading with its points under it
     { t:'field', id, label, optional, prefill } a line they fill in (prefill: 'role' | 'dates')
     { t:'initial', id, label }               a box for their initials (a page's foot)
   sign.age: asks their age; sign.witness: an optional witness signs too;
   sign.guardian: under 18, a parent or guardian signs as well.

   The id of a document and of every tick, field and initial is its handle in
   the signed records — change wording freely, keep the ids. A signature keeps
   a snapshot of exactly the text that was signed, so editing a document later
   never changes what someone already signed. */
