/* Reported as "can't scroll at all" — confirmed live in a real user's own
   Chrome DevTools: wheel events were firing with real deltas, nothing was
   calling preventDefault on them, and the page still would not move, until
   `overscroll-behavior` was set back from `none` to `auto` from the
   console, at which point it scrolled immediately. The first fix tried
   `contain` (same "don't chain a scroll past this page" intent, without
   `none`'s worse reputation) — a second live check on the same real
   machine showed `contain` trips the exact same bug: wheel events firing,
   defaultPrevented false throughout, and window never once emitting a
   `scroll` event. So the actual fix is `auto`, i.e. no overscroll-behavior
   declared on html/body at all.
   This can't reproduce the underlying Chrome bug itself (a synthetic wheel
   sequence in a quick headless test never hit it either — that's part of
   why it took this long to find) — it just holds the actual fix in place:
   neither `html` nor `body`, on any page, may declare
   `overscroll-behavior` at all, at any value. */
